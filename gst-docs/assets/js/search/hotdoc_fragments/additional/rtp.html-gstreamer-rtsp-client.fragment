It can be used as a standalone element\ndirectly, or can be used via playbin by passing an rtsp:// URI to\nplaybin. rtspsrc features a number of GObject properties that allow\nyou to configure it in all kinds of different ways, most notably a\n\"latency\" property to configure the default jitterbuffer latency,\nwhich you may want to configure to a lower value to achieve lower latency.\n"});
