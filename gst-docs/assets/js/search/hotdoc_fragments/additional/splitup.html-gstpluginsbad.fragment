fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/splitup.html#gstpluginsbad","fragment":"gst-plugins-bad\nA set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to the rest. They might be\nclose to being good quality, but they're missing something - be it a good code\nreview, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some\nactual wide use.\nIf the blanks are filled in they might be upgraded to become part of either\ngst-plugins-good or gst-plugins-ugly, depending on the other factors.\n\nIf the plug-ins break, you can't complain - instead, you can fix the problem\nand send us a patch, or bribe someone into fixing them for you\nNew contributors can start here for things to work on\n\n"});
