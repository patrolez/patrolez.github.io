Base functionality and\nlibraries, some essential elements, documentation, and testing.\nBASE\nA well-groomed and well-maintained collection of GStreamer plug-ins and\nelements, spanning the range of possible types of elements one would want to\nwrite for GStreamer.\nAnd introducing, for the first time ever, on the development screen ...\nTHE GOOD\nSuch ingratitude. After all the times I've saved your life.\nA collection of plug-ins you'd want to have right next to you on the\nbattlefield. Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plug-ins have it\nall: good looks, good code, and good licensing. Documented and dressed up in\ntests. If you're looking for a role model to base your own plug-in on, here it\nis.\nIf you find a plot hole or a badly lip-synced line of code in them, let us\nknow - it is a matter of honour for us to ensure Blondie doesn't look like\nhe's been walking 100 miles through the desert without water.\nTHE UGLY\nWhen you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.\nThere are times when the world needs a color between black and white.  Quality\ncode to match the good's, but two-timing, backstabbing and ready to sell your\nfreedom down the river.

Does a mother love her son\nless because he's not as pretty as the other ones? No - she commends him on\nhis great personality. These plug-ins are the life of the party.  And we'll\nstill step in and set them straight if you report any unacceptable behaviour -\nbecause there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend: those with a\nrope around their neck and the people who do the cutting.\nTHE BAD\nThat an accusation?\nNo perfectly groomed moustache or any amount of fine clothing is going to\ncover up the truth - these plug-ins are Bad with a capital B.  They look fine\non the outside, and might even appear to get the job done, but at the end of\nthe day they're a black sheep. Without a golden-haired angel to watch over\nthem, they'll probably land in an unmarked grave at the final showdown.\nDon't bug us about their quality - exercise your Free Software rights, patch\nup the offender and send us the patch on the fastest steed you can steal from\nthe Confederates. Because you see, in this world, there's two kinds of people,\nmy friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig.  You dig.\n\n\nGSTREAMER\nThe core around which all other modules revolve.
