fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/seqnums.html#forcing-eos-on-the-pipeline","fragment":"Forcing EOS on the pipeline\nThe application has a pipeline running and does a\ngst_element_send_event() to the pipeline with an EOS event. All the\nsources in the pipeline will have their send_event handlers called and\nwill receive the event from the application.\nWhen handling this event, the sources will push either the same EOS\ndownstream or create their own EOS event and push. In the later case,\nthe source should copy the seqnum from the original EOS to the newly\ncreated one. This same logic applies to all elements that receive the EOS\ndownstream, either push the same event or, if creating a new one, copy\nthe seqnum.\nWhen the EOS reaches the sink, it will create an EOS message, copy the\nseqnum to the message and post to the bus. The application receives the\nmessage and can compare its seqnum with the one from the\noriginal event sent to the pipeline. If they match, it knows that this\nEOS message was caused by the event it pushed and not from other reason\n(input finished or configured segment was over).\n"});
