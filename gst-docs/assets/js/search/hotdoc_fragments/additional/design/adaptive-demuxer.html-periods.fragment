fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/adaptive-demuxer.html#periods","fragment":"Periods\nThe number and type of GstAdaptiveDemuxTrack and GstAdaptiveDemuxStream can\nnot change once the initial manifests are parsed.\nIn order to change that (for example in the case of a new DASH period), a new\nGstAdaptiveDemuxPeriod must be started.\nAll the tracks and streams that are created at any given time are associated to\nthe current input period. The streams of the input period are the ones that\nare active (i.e. downloading), and by extension the tracks of that input period\nare the ones that are being filled (if selected).\nThat period could also be the output period. The (selected) tracks of that\nperiod are the ones that are used for output by the output thread.\nBut due to buffering, the input and output period could be different, the\nbaseclass will automatically handle switch over.\nThe only requirement for subclasses is to ask the parent class to start a new\nperiod when needed and then create the new tracks and streams.\n"});
