fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/buffering.html#simple-buffering","fragment":"Simple buffering\nNON-live pipelines are kept in the paused state while buffering messages with\na percent < 100% are received.\nThis buffering strategy relies on the buffer size and low/high watermarks of\nthe element. It can work with a fixed size buffer in memory or on disk.\nThe size of the buffer is usually expressed in a fixed amount of time units\nand the estimated bitrate of the upstream source is used to convert this time\nto bytes.\nAll GStreamer applications must implement this strategy. Failure to do so\nwill result in starvation at the sink.\n"});
