fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/gstobject.html#locking-order","fragment":"Locking order\nIn parent-child situations the lock of the parent must always be taken\nfirst before taking the lock of the child. It is NOT allowed to hold the\nchild lock before taking the parent lock.\nThis policy allows for parents to iterate their children and setting\nproperties on them.\nWhenever a nested lock needs to be taken on objects not involved in a\nparent-child relation (eg. pads), an explicit locking order has to be\ndefined.\n"});
