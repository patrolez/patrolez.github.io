The idea\nis the following: when you receive TOC select event, parse it with\ngst_event_parse_toc_select() and seek stream (if it is not\nstreamable) for specified TOC UID (you can use gst_toc_find_entry()\nto find entry in TOC by UID). To create TOC select event use\ngst_event_new_toc_select(). The common action on such event is to\nseek to specified UID within your element.\n\n\ndownstream TOC events that contain TOC information and travel\ndownstream\n\n\ntoc-select events that travel upstream and can be used to select a\ncertain TOC entry for playback (similar to seek events)\n\n\n"});
