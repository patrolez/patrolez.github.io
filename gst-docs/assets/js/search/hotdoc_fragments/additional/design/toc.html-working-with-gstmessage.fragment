Elements extracting TOCs\nshould not post a TOC message themselves, but send a TOC event\ndownstream.\nThe reason for this is that there may be cascades of TOCs (e.g. a zip\narchive containing multiple matroska files, each with a TOC).\nGstMessage with GstToc can be created using gst_message_new_toc() and\nparsed with gst_message_parse_toc(). The updated parameter in these\nmethods indicates whether the TOC was just discovered (set to false) or\nTOC was already found and have been updated (set to true). This message\nwill typically be posted by sinks to pipeline in case you have\ndiscovered TOC data within your element.\n"});
