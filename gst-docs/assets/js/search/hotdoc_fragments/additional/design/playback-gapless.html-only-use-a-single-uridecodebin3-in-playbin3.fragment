The exception to this is if the user/application\nconfigured a specific multi-sinkpad combiner element for a given stream type,\nin which case all streams of that given stream type are linked to that.\nAll uri-related properties are forwarded directly to uridecodebin3, which will\nhandle switching the sources to the single decodebin3 it contains.\n"});
