Indeed, given arrival time T1 as given in (1) we can\nbe certain that buffers with a timestamp B2 < T1 will be too late in\nthe sink.\nIn case of a positive jitter we can therefore send a QoS event with a\ntimestamp B1, jitter J1 and proportion given by (4).\nThis allows an upstream element to not generate any data with timestamps\nB2 < T1, where the element can derive T1 as B1 + J1.\nThis will effectively result in frame drops.\nThe element can even do a better estimation of the next valid timestamp\nit should output.\nIndeed, given the element generated a buffer with timestamp B0 that\narrived in time in the sink but then received a QoS event stating B1\narrived J1 too late. This means generating B1 took (B1 + J1) - B0 = T1 -\nT0 = PT1, as given in (3). Given the buffer B1 had a duration D1 and\nassuming that generating a new buffer B2 will take the same amount of\nprocessing time, a better estimation for B2 would then be:\nexpanding gives:\nassuming the durations of the frames are equal and thus D1 = D2:\nalso:\nso:\nWhich yields a more accurate prediction for the next buffer given as:\n"});
