fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/live-source.html#live-sources","fragment":"Live sources\nA live source is a source that cannot be arbitrarily PAUSED without\nlosing data.\nA live source such as an element capturing audio or video, needs to be\nhandled in a special way. It does not make sense to start the dataflow\nin the PAUSED state for those devices as the user might wait a long time\nbetween going from PAUSED to PLAYING, making the previously captured\nbuffers irrelevant.\nA live source therefore only produces buffers in the PLAYING state. This\nhas implications for sinks waiting for a buffer to complete the preroll\nstate since such a buffer might never arrive.\nLive sources return NO_PREROLL when going to the PAUSED state to inform\nthe bin/pipeline that this element will not be able to produce data in\nthe PAUSED state. NO_PREROLL should be returned for both READY→PAUSED\nand PLAYING→PAUSED.\nWhen performing a get_state() on a bin with a non-zero timeout value,\nthe bin must be sure that there are no live sources in the pipeline\nbecause otherwise, get_state() would block on the sinks.\nA GstBin therefore always performs a zero-timeout get_state() on its\nelements to discover the NO_PREROLL (and ERROR) elements before\nperforming a blocking wait.\n"});
