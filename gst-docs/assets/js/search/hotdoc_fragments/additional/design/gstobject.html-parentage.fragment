This\nis one of the two fundamental requirements for a hierarchical system\nsuch as GStreamer (for the other, read up on GstBin). Three functions\nare provided: _set_parent(), _get_parent(), and _unparent(). The\nthird is required because there is an explicit check in _set_parent():\nan object must not already have a parent if you wish to set one. You\nmust unparent the object first. This allows for new additions later.\n\n\nGstObjectâ€™s that can be parented: GstElement (inside a bin) GstPad (inside an element)\n\n"});
