fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/draft-metadata.html#lost-metadata","fragment":"Lost metadata\nA case slighly different from the previous is that when an application\nsets a GstTagList on a pipeline. Right elements consuming tags do not\nreport which tags have been consumed. Especially when using elements\nthat make metadata persistent, we have no means of knowing which of the\ntags made it into the target stream and which were not serialized.\nIdeally the application would like to know which kind of metadata is\naccepted by a pipleine to reflect that in the UI.\nAlthough it is in practise so that elements implementing GstTagSetter\nare the ones that serialize, this does not have to be so. Otherwise we\ncould add a means to that interface, where elements add the tags they\nhave serialized. The application could build one list from all the tag\nmessages and then query all the serialized tags from tag-setters. The\ndelta tells what has not been serialized.\nA different approach would be to query the list of supported tags in\nadvance. This could be a query (GST_QUERY_TAG_SUPPORT). The query\nresult could be a list of elements and their tags. As a convenience we\ncould flatten the list of tags for the top-level element (if the query\nwas sent to a bin) and add that.\n"});
