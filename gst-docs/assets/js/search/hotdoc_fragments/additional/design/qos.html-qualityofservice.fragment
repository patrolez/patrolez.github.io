Two types of adjustments can be made:\nshort time \"emergency\" corrections based on latest observation in\nthe sinks.\nlong term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks.\nIt is also possible for the application to artificially introduce delay\nbetween synchronized buffers, this is called throttling. It can be used\nto reduce the framerate, for example.\n\n\nshort time \"emergency\" corrections based on latest observation in\nthe sinks.\n\n\nlong term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks.\n\n\n"});
