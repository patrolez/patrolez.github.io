This is\nthe case when their intersection is not empty.\nFor checking if a pad actually supports a fixed caps an intersection is\nnot enough. Instead the fixed caps must be at least a subset of the\npadâ€™s caps but pads can introduce additional constraints which would\nbe checked in the ACCEPT_CAPS query handler.\nData flow can only happen after pads have decided on common fixed caps.\nThese caps are distributed to both pads with the CAPS event.\n"});
