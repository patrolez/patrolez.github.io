This message instructs the\npipeline to:\nquery the latency in the pipeline (which might now have changed)\nwith a LATENCY query.\nredistribute a new global latency to all elements with a LATENCY\nevent.\nA use case where the latency in a pipeline can change could be a network\nelement that observes an increased inter-packet arrival jitter or\nexcessive packet loss and decides to increase its internal buffering\n(and thus the latency). The element must post a LATENCY message and\nperform the additional latency adjustments when it receives the LATENCY\nevent from the downstream peer element.\nIn a similar way, the latency can be decreased when network conditions\nimprove.\nLatency adjustments will introduce playback glitches in the sinks and\nmust only be performed in special conditions.\n\n\nquery the latency in the pipeline (which might now have changed)\nwith a LATENCY query.\n\n\nredistribute a new global latency to all elements with a LATENCY\nevent.\n\n\n"});
