Unlike the buffers, events\ncan pass both upstream and downstream. Some events only travel upstream\nothers only downstream.\nThe events are used to denote special conditions in the dataflow such as\nEOS or to inform plugins of special events such as flushing or seeking.\nSome events must be serialized with the buffer flow, others donâ€™t.\nSerialized events are inserted between the buffers. Non serialized\nevents jump in front of any buffers current being processed.\nAn example of a serialized event is a TAG event that is inserted between\nbuffers to mark metadata for those buffers.\nAn example of a non serialized event is the FLUSH event.\n"});
