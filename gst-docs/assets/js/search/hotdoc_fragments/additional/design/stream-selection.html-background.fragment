fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stream-selection.html#background","fragment":"Background\nThis new API is intended to address the use cases described in this section:\nAs a user/app I want an overview and control of the media streams that can be\nconfigured within a pipeline for processing, even when some streams are\nmutually exclusive or logical constructs only.\nThe user/app can disable entirely streams it's not interested in so they\ndon't occupy memory or processing power - discarded as early as possible in\nthe pipeline. The user/app can also (re-)enable them at a later time.\nIf the set of possible stream configurations is changing, the user/app should\nbe aware of the pending change and be able to make configuration choices for\nthe new set of streams, as well as possibly still reconfiguring the old set\nElements that have some other internal mechanism for triggering stream\nselections (DVD, or maybe some scripted playback playlist) should be able to\ntrigger 'selection' of some particular stream.\nIndicate known relationships between streams - for example that 2 separate\nvideo feeds represent the 2 views of a stereoscopic view, or that certain\nstreams are mutually exclusive.\nNote: the streams that are \"available\" are not automatically the ones active,\nor present in the pipeline as pads. Think HLS/DASH alternate streams.\n"});
