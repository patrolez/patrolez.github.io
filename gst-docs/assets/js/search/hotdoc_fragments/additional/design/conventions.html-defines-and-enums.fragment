fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/conventions.html#defines-and-enums","fragment":"defines and enums\nValues and macros defined as enums and preprocessor macros will be\nreferred to in all capitals, as per their definition. This includes\nobject flags and element states, as well as general enums. Examples are\nthe states NULL, READY, PLAYING, and PAUSED; the element flags\nLOCKED_STATE, and state return values SUCCESS, FAILURE, and ASYNC.\nWhere there is a prefix, as in the element flags, it is usually dropped\nand implied. Note however that element flags should be cross-checked\nwith the header, as there are currently two conventions in use: with and\nwithout *FLAGS* in the middle.\n"});
