fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/adaptive-demuxer.html#download-helper-and-thread","fragment":"Download helper and thread\nBased on the above, each Adaptive Demuxer implementation specifies to a\nDownload Loop which fragment to download next and when.\nMultiple downloads can be requested at the same time on that thread. It is the\nresponsibility of the Scheduler thread to decide what to do when a download is\ncompleted.\nSince all downloads are done in a dedicated thread without any blocking, it can\nestimate current bandwidth and latency, which the element can use to switch\nvariants and improve buffering strategy.\nNote: Unlike the old design, the libsoup library is used directly for\ndownloading, and not via external GStreamer elements. In the future, this\ncould be made modular so that other HTTP libraries can be used instead.\n"});
