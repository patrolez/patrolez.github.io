These were used to mark gaps between buffers so that\ndownstream elements could know not to expect any more data for that gap.\nIn 0.10, segment information conveyed through SEGMENT events can be used\nfor the same purpose.\nIn 1.0, there is a GAP event that works in a similar fashion as the\nFILLER event in 0.8.\n"});
