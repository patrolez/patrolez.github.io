This is to allow downstream stream switching to happen as fast as\npossible.\nThe only exception to this is if extra processing (such as network download) can\nbe avoided upstream as is the case with HLS/DASH sources. Those elements inform\nother downstream elements of this capability by replying to the\nGST_QUERY_SELECTABLE. They are also responsible for selecting a default\nselection of streams to output (one of each available GstStreamType) if no\nGST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS was received before.\nFurthermore, for all elements, stream-selection can only happen if the GstBin\nthey are in has the GST_BIN_FLAG_STREAMS_AWARE flag set.\nLater design/API will be researched to allow use-cases where regular demuxers\ncould completely disable outputting some of the contained streams (to allow more\nefficient I/O and memory usage).\n"});
