fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/clocks.html#clock-selection","fragment":"Clock Selection\nTo synchronize the different elements, the GstPipeline is responsible\nfor selecting and distributing a global GstClock for all the elements in\nit.\nThis selection happens whenever the pipeline goes to PLAYING. Whenever\nan element is added/removed from the pipeline, this selection will be\nredone in the next state change to PLAYING. Adding an element that can\nprovide a clock will post a GST_MESSAGE_CLOCK_PROVIDE message on the\nbus to inform parent bins of the fact that a clock recalculation is\nneeded.\nWhen a clock is selected, a NEW_CLOCK message is posted on the bus\nsignaling the clock to the application.\nWhen the element that provided the clock is removed from the pipeline, a\nCLOCK_LOST message is posted. The application must then set the\npipeline to PAUSED and PLAYING again in order to let the pipeline select\na new clock and distribute a new base time.\nThe clock selection is performed as part of the state change from PAUSED\nto PLAYING and is described in states.\n"});
