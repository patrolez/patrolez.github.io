They use the refcount\nvalue to control writability of the object.\nWhen the refcount of the miniobject is > 1, the objects it referenced by at\nleast 2 objects and is thus considered unwritable. A copy must be made before a\nmodification to the object can be done.\nUsing the refcount to control writability is problematic for many language\nbindings that can keep additional references to the objects. This method is\nmainly for historical reasons until all users of the miniobjects are\nconverted to use the LOCKABLE flag.\n"});
