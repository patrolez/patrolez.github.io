Normally, it will take some time to capture\nthe first sample of data and the last one. This means that when the\nbuffer arrives at the sink, it will already be late and will be dropped.\nThe latency is the time it takes to construct one buffer of data and it's\nexposed with a LATENCY query.\nSee latency\n"});
