fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/encoding.html#categorisation-of-presets","fragment":"Categorisation of presets.\nCurrently presets are just aliases of a group of property/value without\nany meanings or explanation as to how they exclude each other.\nTake for example the H264 encoder. It can have presets for: * passes\n(1,2 or 3 passes) * profiles (Baseline, Main, ...) * quality (Low,\nmedium, High)\nIn order to programmatically know which presets exclude each other, we\nhere propose the categorisation of these presets.\nThis can be done in one of two ways 1. in the name (by making the name\nbe [<category>:]<name>) This would give for example: \"Quality:High\",\n\"Profile:Baseline\" 2. by adding a new _meta key This would give for\nexample: _meta/category:quality\n"});
