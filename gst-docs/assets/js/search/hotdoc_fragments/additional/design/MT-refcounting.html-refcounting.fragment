Each reference\nobtained to the object should increase the refcount and each reference lost\nshould decrease the refcount.\nThe refcounting is used to make sure that when another thread destroys the\nobject, the ones which still hold a reference to the object do not read from\ninvalid memory when accessing the object.\nRefcounting is also used to ensure that mutable data structures are only\nmodified when they are owned by the calling code.\nIt is a requirement that when two threads have a handle on an object, the\nrefcount must be more than one. This means that when one thread passes an\nobject to another thread it must increase the refcount. This requirement makes\nsure that one thread cannot suddenly dispose the object making the other\nthread crash when it tries to access the pointer to invalid memory.\n"});
