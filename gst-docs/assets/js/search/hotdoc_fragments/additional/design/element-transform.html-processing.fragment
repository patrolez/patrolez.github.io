The\noutput buffer is guaranteed to be writable and different from the input buffer.\ntransform_ip(): Transform the input buffer in-place. The input buffer\nis writable and of bigger or equal size than the output buffer.\nA transform can operate in the following modes:\npassthrough: The element will not make changes to the buffers, buffers are\npushed straight through, caps on both sides need to be the same. The element\ncan optionally implement a transform_ip() function to take a look at the data,\nthe buffer does not have to be writable.\nin-place: Changes can be made to the input buffer directly to obtain the\noutput buffer. The transform must implement a transform_ip() function.\ncopy-transform: The transform is performed by copying and transforming the\ninput buffer to a new output buffer. The transform must implement a transform() function.\nWhen no transform() function is provided, only in-place and passthrough\noperation is allowed, this means that source and destination caps must\nbe equal or that the source buffer size is bigger or equal than the\ndestination buffer.\nWhen no transform_ip() function is provided, only passthrough and\ncopy-transforms are supported. Providing this function is an\noptimisation that can avoid a buffer copy.\nWhen no functions are provided, we can only process in passthrough mode.\n\n\ntransform(): Transform the input buffer to the output buffer.
