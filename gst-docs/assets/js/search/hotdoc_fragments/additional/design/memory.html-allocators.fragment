Allocators are a subclass\nof GstObject and can be subclassed to make custom allocators.\nThe allocator class has 2 virtual methods. One to create a GstMemory,\nanother to free it.\nAllocators are refcounted. It is also possible to register the allocator to the\nGStreamer system. This way, the allocator can be retrieved by name.\nAfter an allocator is created, new GstMemory can be created with\nGstAllocationParams contain extra info such as flags, alignment, prefix and\npadding.\nThe GstMemory object is a refcounted object that must be freed with\ngst_memory_unref().\nThe GstMemory keeps a ref to the allocator that allocated it. Inside the\nallocator are the most common GstMemory operations listed. Custom\nGstAllocator implementations must implement the various operations on\nthe memory they allocate.\nIt is also possible to create a new GstMemory object that wraps existing\nmemory with:\n"});
