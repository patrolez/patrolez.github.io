fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stream-selection.html#changes-of-stream-collection","fragment":"Changes of stream collection\nAt some point in time, a PMT change happens. Let's assume a change in\nvideo-codec and/or PID.\nThe demuxer creates a new GstStream for the changed/new stream, creates a new\nGstStreamCollection for the updated PMT and posts it.\ndecodebin3 sees the new GstStreamCollection message.\nThe demuxer (and parsebin) then adds and removes pads:\ndecodebin3 will match the new pads to GstStream in the new\nGstStreamCollection the same way it did\nfor the initial pads previously.\ndecodebin3 will see whether the new stream can re-use a multiqueue slot\nused by a stream of the same type no longer present (it compares the old\ncollection to the new collection).  In this case, decodebin3 sees that the\nnew video stream can re-use the same slot as the previous video stream.\nIf the new stream is going to be active by default (in this case it does\nbecause we are replacing the only video stream, which was active), it will\ncheck whether the caps are compatible with the existing video decoder (in the\nsame way it was done for the audio decoder\nswitch).\nFinally, the stream that switched will be decoded and output through the same\npad as the previous video stream in a gapless fashion.\n"});
