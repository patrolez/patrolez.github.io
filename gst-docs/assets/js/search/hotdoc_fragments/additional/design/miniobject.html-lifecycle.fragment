When a GstMiniObject is first created, it\nhas a refcount of 1.\nEach variable holding a reference to a GstMiniObject is responsible for\nupdating the refcount. This includes incrementing the refcount with\ngst_mini_object_ref() when a reference is kept to a miniobject or\ngst_mini_object_unref() when a reference is released.\nWhen the refcount reaches 0, and thus no objects hold a reference to the\nminiobject anymore, we can free the miniobject.\nWhen freeing the miniobject, first the GstMiniObjectDisposeFunction is\ncalled. This function is allowed to revive the object again by\nincrementing the refcount, in which case it should return FALSE from the\ndispose function. The dispose function is used by GstBuffer to revive\nthe buffer back into the GstBufferPool when needed.\nWhen the dispose function returns TRUE, the GstMiniObjectFreeFunction\nwill be called and the miniobject will be freed.\n"});
