This can happens as we donâ€™t map all metadata fields to generic\nones.\nWe should probably also add the whole metadata blob to the GstTagList.\nWe would need a GST_TAG_SYSTEM_xxx define (e.g.\nGST_TAG_SYSTEM_ID3V2) for each standard. The content is not printable\nand should be treated as binary if not known. The tag is not mergeable -\ncall gst_tag_register() with GstTagMergeFunc=NULL. Also the tag data\nis only useful for upstream elements, not for the application.\nA muxer would first scan a taglist for known system tags. Unknown tags\nare ignored as already. It would first populate its own metadata store\nwith the entries from the system tag and the update the entries with the\ndata in normal tags.\nBelow is an initial list of tag systems: ID3V1 - GST_TAG_SYSTEM_ID3V1\nID3V2 - GST_TAG_SYSTEM_ID3V2 RIFF_INFO -\nGST_TAG_SYSTEM_RIFF_INFO XMP - GST_TAG_SYSTEM_XMP\nWe would basically need this for each container format.\nSee also https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=345352\n"});
