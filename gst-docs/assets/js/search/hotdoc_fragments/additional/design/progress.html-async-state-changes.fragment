fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/progress.html#async-state-changes","fragment":"Async state changes\nGStreamer currently has a GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC return value to note\nto the application that a state change is happening asynchronously.\nThe main purpose of this return value is to make the pipeline wait for\npreroll and delay a future (upwards) state changes until the sinks are\nprerolled.\nIn the case of async operations on source, this will automatically force\nsinks to stay async because they will not preroll before the source can\nproduce data.\nThe fact that other asynchronous operations happen behind the scenes is\nirrelevant for the prerolling process so it is not implemented with the\nASYNC state change return value in order to not complicate the state\nchanges and mix concepts.\n"});
