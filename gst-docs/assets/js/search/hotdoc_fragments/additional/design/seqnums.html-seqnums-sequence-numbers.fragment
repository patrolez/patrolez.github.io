They are used to\nidentify a group of events and messages as being part of the same\noperation over the pipeline.\nWhenever a new event or message is created, a seqnum is set into them.\nThis seqnum is created from an ever increasing source (starting from 0\nbut it might wrap around), so each new event and message gets a new and\nhopefully unique seqnum.\nSuppose an element receives an event A and, as part of the logic of\nhandling the event A, creates a new event B. B should have its seqnum be\nthe same as A, because they are part of the same operation. The same\nlogic applies if this element had to create multiple events or messages,\nall of those should have the seqnum set to the value on the received\nevent. For example, when a sink element receives an EOS event and\ncreates a new EOS message to post, it should copy the seqnum from the\nevent to the message because the EOS message is a consequence of the EOS\nevent being received.\nPreserving the seqnums accross related events and messages allows the\nelements and applications to identify a set of events/messages as being\npart of a single operation on the pipeline. For example, flushes,\nsegments and EOS that are related to a seek event started by the\napplication.\nSeqnums are also useful for elements to discard duplicated events,\navoiding handling them again.\n"});
