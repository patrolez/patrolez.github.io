When the\npercentage field in the BUFFERING message is 100, buffering is done.\nValues less than 100 mean that buffering is in progress.\nThe BUFFERING message should be intercepted and acted upon by the\napplication. The message contains at least one field that is sufficient\nfor basic functionality:\nSeveral more clever ways of dealing with the buffering messages can be\nused when in incremental or timeshifting download mode. For this purpose\nadditional fields are added to the buffering message:\nbuffering-mode, GST_TYPE_BUFFERING_MODE: enum { \"stream\", \"download\", \"timeshift\", \"live\" }: Buffering mode in use. See above for an explanation of the different\nalternatives. This field can be used to let the application have more control\nover the buffering process.\navg-in-rate, G_TYPE_INT: Average input buffering speed in bytes/second.\n-1 is unknown. This is the average number of bytes per second that is received\non the buffering element input (sink) pads. It is a measurement of the network\nspeed in most cases.\navg-out-rate, G_TYPE_INT: Average consumption speed in bytes/second. -1\nis unknown. This is the average number of bytes per second that is consumed by\nthe downstream element of the buffering element.\nbuffering-left, G_TYPE_INT64: Estimated time that buffering will take\nin milliseconds. -1 is unknown. This is measured based on the avg-in-rate and\nthe filled level of the queue. The application can use this hint to update the\nGUI about the estimated remaining time that buffering will take.\n\n\nbuffer-percent, G_TYPE_INT: between 0 and 100\n\n\n\nbuffering-mode, GST_TYPE_BUFFERING_MODE: enum { \"stream\", \"download\", \"timeshift\", \"live\" }: Buffering mode in use.
