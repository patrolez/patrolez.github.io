It will be\nsent a GST_EVENT_TAG to downstream elements. When a sink element\nreceives a tag event, it will post a GST_MESSAGE_TAG message on the\nbus with the contents of the tag event.\nElements receiving GST_EVENT_TAG events can mangle them, mux them into\nthe buffers they send or just pass them through. Usually is muxers that\nwill format the tag data into the form required by the format they mux.\nSuch elements would also implement the GstTagSetter interface to receive\ntags from the application.\nThe data used in all those interfaces is GstTagList. It is based on a\nGstStructure which is like a hash table with differently typed entries.\nThe key is always a string/GQuark. Many keys are predefined in GStreamer\ncore. More keys are defined in gst-plugins-base/gst-libs/gst/tag/tag.h.\nIf elements and applications use predefined types, it is possible to\ntranscode a file from one format into another while preserving all known\nand mapped metadata.\n"});
