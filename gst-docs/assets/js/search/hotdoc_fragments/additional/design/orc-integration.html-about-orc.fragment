fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/orc-integration.html#about-orc","fragment":"About Orc\nOrc code can be in one of two forms: in .orc files that is converted by\norcc to C code that calls liborc functions, or C code that calls liborc\nto create complex operations at runtime. The former is mostly for\nfunctions with predetermined functionality. The latter is for\nfunctionality that is determined at runtime, where writing .orc\nfunctions for all combinations would be prohibitive. Orc also has a fast\nmemcpy and memset which are useful independently.\n"});
