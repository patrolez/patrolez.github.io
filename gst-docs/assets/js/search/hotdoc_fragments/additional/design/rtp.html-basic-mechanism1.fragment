When\nit receives the event GstRTPRetransmissionRequest from the downstream\ngstrtpsession element, it looks up the requested seqnum in its stored\npackets. If the packet is present in its history, it will create an RTX\npacket according to RFC 4588. Then this rtx packet is pushed to its src\npad like other packets.\nrtprtxsend works in SSRC-multiplexed mode, so it always has one sink and\nsrc pad.\n"});
