fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/element-sink.html#state-changes","fragment":"state changes\nA sink always returns ASYNC from the state change to PAUSED, this\nincludes a state change from READY→PAUSED and PLAYING→PAUSED. The reason\nfor this is that this way we can detect when the first buffer or event\narrives in the sink when the state change completes.\nA sink should block on the first EOS event or buffer received in the\nREADY→PAUSED state before committing the state to PAUSED.\nFLUSHING events have to be handled out of sync with the buffer flow and\ntake no part in the preroll procedure.\nEvents other than EOS do not complete the preroll stage.\n"});
