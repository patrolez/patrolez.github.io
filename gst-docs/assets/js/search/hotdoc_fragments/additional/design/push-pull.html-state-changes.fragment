fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/push-pull.html#state-changes","fragment":"State changes\nThe GstBin sets the state of all the sink elements. These are the\nelements without source pads.\nSetting the state on an element will first activate all the srcpads and\nthen the sinkpads. For each of the sinkpads,\ngst_pad_check_pull_range() is performed. If the sinkpad supports a\nloopfunction and the peer pad returns TRUE from the GstPadCheckPullRange\nfunction, then the peer pad is activated first as it must be in the\nright state to handle a _pull_range(). Note that the state change of\nthe element is not yet performed, just the activate function is called\non the source pad. This means that elements that implement a getrange\nfunction must be prepared to get their activate function called before\ntheir state change function.\nElements that have multiple sinkpads that require all of them to operate\nin the same mode (push/pull) can use the _check_pull_range() on all\ntheir pads and can then remove the loop functions if one of the pads\ndoes not support pull based mode.\n"});
