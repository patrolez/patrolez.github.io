This means that API functions\ncan be called from multiple threads at the same time. GStreamer internally uses\nthreads to perform the data passing and various asynchronous services such as\nthe clock can also use threads.\nThis design decision has implications for the usage of the API and the objects\nwhich this document explains.\n"});
