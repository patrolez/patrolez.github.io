fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/audiosinks.html#getrange-based-mode","fragment":"getrange based mode\nIn getrange based mode, the audiobasesink will use the callback\nfunction of the ringbuffer to get a segsize samples from the peer\nelement. These samples will then be placed in the ringbuffer at the\nnext play position. It is assumed that the getrange function returns\nfast enough to fill the ringbuffer before the play pointer reaches\nthe write pointer.\nIn this mode, the ringbuffer is usually kept as empty as possible.\nThere is no context switch needed between the elements that create\nthe samples and the actual writing of the samples to the device.\n"});
