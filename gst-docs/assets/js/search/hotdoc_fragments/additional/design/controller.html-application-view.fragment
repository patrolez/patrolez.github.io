For that they need\nto create a GstControlSource and attach it to a property using\nGstControlBinding. Various control-sources and control-bindings exist.\nAll control sources produce control value sequences in the form of\ngdouble values. The control bindings map them to the value range and\ntype of the bound property.\nOne control-source can be attached to one or more properties at the same\ntime. If it is attached multiple times, then each control-binding will\nscale and convert the control values to the target property type and\nrange.\nOne can create complex control-curves by using a\nGstInterpolationControlSource. This allows the classic user editable\ncontrol-curve (often seen in audio/video editors). Another way is to use\ncomputed control curves. GstLFOControlSource can generate various\nrepetitive signals. Those can be made more complex by chaining the\ncontrol sources. One can attach another control-source to e.g. modulate\nthe frequency of the first GstLFOControlSource.\nIn most cases GstDirectControlBinding will be the binding to be used.\nOther control bindings are there to handle special cases, such as having\n1-4 control- sources and combine their values into a single guint to\ncontrol a rgba-color property.\n"});
