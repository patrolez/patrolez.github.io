This class is mostly useful for\nelements that cannot do random access, or at least very slowly. The\nsource usually prefers to push out a fixed size buffer.\nClasses extending this base class will usually be scheduled in a push\nbased mode. If the peer accepts to operate without offsets and within\nthe limits of the allowed block size, this class can operate in getrange\nbased mode automatically.\nThe subclass should extend the methods from the baseclass in addition to\nthe create method. If the source is seekable, it needs to override\nGstBaseSrc::event() in addition to GstBaseSrc::is_seekable() in order\nto retrieve the seek offset, which is the offset of the next buffer to\nbe requested.\nFlushing, scheduling and sync is all handled by this base class.\n"});
