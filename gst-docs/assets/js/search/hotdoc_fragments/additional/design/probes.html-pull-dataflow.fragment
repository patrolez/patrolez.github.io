fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/probes.html#pull-dataflow","fragment":"Pull dataflow\nPull probes have the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PULL flag set in the\ncallbacks.\nThe gst_pad_pull_range() call will first trigger the BLOCK probes\nwithout a DATA item. This allows the pad to be linked before the peer\npad is resolved. It also allows the callback to set a data item in the\nprobe info.\nAfter the blocking probe and the getrange function is called on the peer\npad and there is a data item, the DATA probes are called.\nWhen control returns to the sinkpad, the IDLE callbacks are called. The\nIDLE callback is called without a data item so that it will also be\ncalled when there was an error.\nIf there is a valid DATA item, the DATA probes are called for the item.\n"});
