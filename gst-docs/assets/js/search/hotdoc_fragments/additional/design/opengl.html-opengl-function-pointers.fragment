fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/opengl.html#opengl-function-pointers","fragment":"OpenGL Function Pointers\nAnother design choice of OpenGL is that (at least on the windows platform)\nOpenGL functions can be OpenGL context specific.  This means that retrieving a\nfunction pointer from one OpenGL context has no guarentee of doing the correct\nthing with any other OpenGL context.  Each GstGLContext has a GstGLFuncs\nstructure that contains a list of OpenGL functions known to libgstgl that is\npopulated by a call to gst_gl_context_fill_info().\n"});
