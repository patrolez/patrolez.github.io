The downstream peer pad will receive the\nbuffer in the Chain function. In the push mode, the source element is\nthe driving force in the pipeline as it initiates data transport.\nIt is also possible for an element to pull data from an upstream\nelement. The downstream element does this by calling\ngst_pad_pull_range() on one of its sinkpads. In this mode, the\ndownstream element is the driving force in the pipeline as it initiates\ndata transfer.\nIt is important that the elements are in the correct state to handle a\npush() or a pull_range() from the peer element. For push() based\nelements this means that all downstream elements should be in the\ncorrect state and for pull_range() based elements this means the\nupstream elements should be in the correct state.\nMost sinkpads implement a chain function. This is the most common case.\nsinkpads implementing a loop function will be the exception. Likewise,\nsrcpads implementing a getrange function will be the exception.\n"});
