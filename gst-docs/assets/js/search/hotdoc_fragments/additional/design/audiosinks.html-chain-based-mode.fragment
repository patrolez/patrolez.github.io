fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/audiosinks.html#chain-based-mode","fragment":"chain based mode\nIn chain based mode, bytes are written into the ringbuffer. This\noperation will eventually block when the ringbuffer is filled.\nWhen no samples arrive in time, the ringbuffer will play silence. Each\nbuffer that arrives will be placed into the ringbuffer at the correct\ntimes. This means that dropping samples or inserting silence is done\nautomatically and very accurate and independent of the play pointer.\nIn this mode, the ringbuffer is usually kept as full as possible. When\nusing a small buffer (small segsize and segtotal), the latency for audio\nto start from the sink to when it is played can be kept low but at least\none context switch has to be made between read and write.\n"});
