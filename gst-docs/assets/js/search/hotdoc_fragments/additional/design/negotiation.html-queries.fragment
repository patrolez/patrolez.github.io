The list of supported caps can be used to choose an\nappropriate GstCaps for the data transfer. The CAPS query works\nrecursively, elements should take their peers into consideration when\nconstructing the possible caps. Because the result caps can be very\nlarge, a filter can be used to restrict the caps. Only the caps that\nmatch the filter will be returned as the result caps. The order of the\nfilter caps gives the order of preference of the caller and should be\ntaken into account for the returned caps.\nA pad can ask the peer pad if it supports a given caps. It does this\nwith the ACCEPT_CAPS query. The caps must be fixed. The ACCEPT_CAPS\nquery is not required to work recursively, it can simply return TRUE if\na subsequent CAPS event with those caps would return success.\n\n\nfilter (in) GST_TYPE_CAPS (default NULL): - a GstCaps to filter the results against\n\ncaps (out) GST_TYPE_CAPS (default NULL): - the result caps\n\n\n\ncaps (in) GST_TYPE_CAPS: - a GstCaps to check, must be fixed\n\nresult (out) G_TYPE_BOOLEAN (default FALSE): - TRUE if the caps are accepted\n\n"});
