Most\nuseful operations can be performed with the methods so it is seldom required\nto access the public fields manually.\nAll accessor methods that return an object should increase the refcount of the\nreturned object. The caller should _unref() the object after usage. Each\nmethod should state this refcounting policy in the documentation.\n"});
