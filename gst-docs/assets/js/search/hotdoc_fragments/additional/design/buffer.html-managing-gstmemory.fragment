fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/buffer.html#managing-gstmemory","fragment":"Managing GstMemory\nA GstBuffer contains an array of pointers to GstMemory objects.\nWhen the buffer is writable, gst_buffer_insert_memory() can be used\nto add a new GstMemory object to the buffer. When the array of memory is\nfull, memory will be merged to make room for the new memory object.\ngst_buffer_n_memory() is used to get the amount of memory blocks on\nthe GstBuffer.\nWith gst_buffer_peek_memory(), memory can be retrieved from the\nmemory array. The desired access pattern for the memory block should be\nspecified so that appropriate checks can be made and, in case of\nGST_MAP_WRITE, a writable copy can be constructed when needed.\ngst_buffer_remove_memory_range() and gst_buffer_remove_memory()\ncan be used to remove memory from the GstBuffer.\n"});
