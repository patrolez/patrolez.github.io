It\ndoes not have to (re)add all pads of the new stream set, emit no-more-pads\nand then remove olds source pads.\nThis method is more efficient than the legacy behaviour, but is opt-in. Several\nelements (playbin3, decodebin3, urisourcebin and more) have this flag set\nby default. Application developers creating custom GstBin can set the flag to\nmake compatible elements add/remove pads dynamically.\n"});
