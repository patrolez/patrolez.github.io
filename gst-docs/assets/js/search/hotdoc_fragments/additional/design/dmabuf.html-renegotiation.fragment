For example, some sink\nelement may not know the preferred DRM fourcc/modifier until the real\nrender target window is realized. Then, it will send a \"reconfigure\" event\nto upstream element to require a renegotiation. At this round negotiation,\nthe downstream element will provide a more precise drm-format list.\n"});
