A\nrecommendation to guarantee uniqueness of the naming could be:\n/\n\nDescription This is a translatable string describing the profile\nMuxing format This is a string containing the GStreamer media-type\nof the container format.\nMuxing preset This is an optional string describing the preset(s) to\nuse on the muxer.\nMultipass setting This is a boolean describing whether the profile\nrequires several passes.\nList of Stream Profile\n\n\nType The type of stream profile (audio, video, text, private-data)\nEncoding Format This is a string containing the GStreamer media-type\nof the encoding format to be used. If encoding is not to be applied,\nthe raw audio media type will be used.\nEncoding preset This is an optional string describing the preset(s)\nto use on the encoder.\nRestriction This is an optional GstCaps containing the restriction\nof the stream that can be fed to the encoder. This will generally\ncontaining restrictions in video width/heigh/framerate or audio\ndepth.\npresence This is an integer specifying how many streams can be used\nin the containing profile. 0 means that any number of streams can be\nused.\npass This is an integer which is only meaningful if the multipass\nflag has been set in the profile. If it has been set it indicates\nwhich pass this Stream Profile corresponds to.\n\n"});
