fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/probes.html#blocking-probes","fragment":"Blocking probes\nBlocking probes are probes with BLOCK or IDLE flags set. They will always\nblock the dataflow and trigger the callback according to the following rules:\nWhen the IDLE flag is set, the probe callback is called as soon as no data is\nflowing over the pad. If at the time of probe registration, the pad is idle,\nthe callback will be called immediately from the current thread. Otherwise,\nthe callback will be called as soon as the pad becomes idle in the streaming\nthread.\nThe IDLE probe is useful in performing dynamic linking, allowing the application\nto wait to correctly execute an unlink/link operation. Since the probe is a\nblocking probe, it will also make sure that the pad stays idle until the probe\nis removed.\nWhen the BLOCK flag is set, the probe callback will be called when new data\narrives on the pad and right before the pad goes into the blocking state. This\ncallback is thus only called when there is new data on the pad.\nThe blocking probe is removed with gst_pad_remove_probe() or when the probe\ncallback return GST_PAD_PROBE_REMOVE. In both cases, and if this was the last\nblocking probe on the pad, the pad is unblocked and dataflow can continue.\n"});
