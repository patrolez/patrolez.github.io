fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/gstbin.html#duration","fragment":"DURATION\nWhen a DURATION query is performed on a bin, it will forward the query\nto all its sink elements. The bin will calculate the total duration as\nthe MAX of all returned durations and will then cache the result so that\nany further queries can use the cached version. The reason for caching the\nresult is because the duration of a stream typically does not change\nthat often.\nA GST_MESSAGE_DURATION_CHANGED posted by an element will clear the\ncached duration value so that the bin will query the sinks again. This\nmessage is typically posted by elements that calculate the duration of\nthe stream based on some average bitrate, which might change while\nplaying the stream. The DURATION_CHANGED message is posted to the\napplication, which can then fetch the updated DURATION.\n"});
