fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/opengl.html#automatic-transfers-tofrom-the-gpu","fragment":"Automatic Transfers To/From The GPU\nBoth GstGLMemory and GstGLBuffer implement automatic transfers to and from\nOpenGL based entirely on the sequence of calls to gst_memory_map() /\ngst_memory_unmap().  Combined with a special GstMapFlags, GST_MAP_GL, the\nOpenGL based GstMemory implementations can discern where the most recent\ndata was written and copy the data on-demand to where it is needed on read.\nInternally this is implemented using two extra GstMemoryFlags,\nGST_GL_BASE_MEMORY_TRANSFER_NEED_DOWNLOAD and\nGST_GL_BASE_MEMORY_TRANSFER_NEED_UPLOAD that indicate that a transfer is\nneeded if that specific domain (system memory or OpenGL) is mapped.\nThe transfer flags are automatically updated and should not be modified by\nelements or the application.\n"});
