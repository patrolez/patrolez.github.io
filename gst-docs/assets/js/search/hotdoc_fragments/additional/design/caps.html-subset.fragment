fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/caps.html#subset","fragment":"Subset\nOne caps \"A\" is a subset of another caps \"B\" if for each structure in\n\"A\" there exists a structure in \"B\" that is a superset of the structure\nin \"A\".\nA structure \"a\" is the subset of a structure \"b\" if it has the same\nstructure name, the same caps features and each field in \"b\" either does not\nexist in \"a\", or the value of the field in \"a\" is a subset of the value of the\nfield in \"b\". \"a\" must not have additional fields that are not in \"b\". Fields\nthat are in \"b\" but not in \"a\" (aka, an empty field) are always a subset.\nThis is different to the intuitive mathematical definition as an empty field\nis defined to contain all possible values. This means that the empty field is\nalways a superset of any other field.\nEMPTY caps are a subset of every other caps. Every caps are a subset of\nANY caps.\n"});
