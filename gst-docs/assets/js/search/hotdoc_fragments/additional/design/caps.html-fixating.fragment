A structure is fixed if none of its fields\nis of an unfixed type, for example a range, list or array.\nFor fixating caps only the first structure is kept, as the order in\nwhich they appear is meant to express their precedence.\nAfterwards, each unfixed field of this structure is set to\nthe value that makes most sense for the media format by the element or\npad implementation and then every remaining unfixed field is set to an\narbitrary value that is a subset of the unfixed fieldâ€™s values.\nEMPTY caps are fixed caps and ANY caps are not. Caps with ANY caps\nfeatures are not fixed.\n"});
