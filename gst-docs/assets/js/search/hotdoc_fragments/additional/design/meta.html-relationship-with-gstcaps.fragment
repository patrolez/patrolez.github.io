fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/meta.html#relationship-with-gstcaps","fragment":"Relationship with GstCaps\nThe difference between GstCaps, used in negotiation, and the metadata is\nnot clearly defined.\nWe would like to think of the GstCaps containing the information needed\nto functionally negotiate the format between two elements. The Metadata\nshould then only contain variables that can change between each buffer.\nFor example, for video we would have width/height/framerate in the caps\nbut then have the more technical details, such as stride, data pointers,\npan/crop/zoom etc in the metadata.\nA scheme like this would still allow us to functionally specify the\ndesired video resolution while the implementation details would be\ninside the metadata.\n"});
