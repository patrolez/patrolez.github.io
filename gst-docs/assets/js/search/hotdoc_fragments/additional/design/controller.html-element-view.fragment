They need to: - mark object properties\nthat can be changed while processing with GST_PARAM_CONTROLLABLE -\ncall gst_object_sync_values (self, timestamp) in the processing\nfunction before accessing the parameters.\nAll ordered property types can be automated (int, double, boolean,\nenum). Other property types can also be automated by using special\ncontrol bindings. One can e.g. write a control-binding that updates a\ntext property based on timestamps.\n"});
