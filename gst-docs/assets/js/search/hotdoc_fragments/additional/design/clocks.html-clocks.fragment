fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/clocks.html#clocks","fragment":"Clocks\nThe GstClock returns a monotonically increasing time with the method\n_get_time(). Its accuracy and base time depends on the specific clock\nimplementation but time is always expressed in nanoseconds. Since the\nbaseline of the clock is undefined, the clock time returned is not\nmeaningful in itself, what matters are the deltas between two clock\ntimes. The time reported by the clock is called the absolute_time.\n"});
