fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/qos.html#qos-message","fragment":"QoS message\nA QOS message is posted on the bus whenever an element decides to:\ndrop a buffer because of QoS reasons\nchange its processing strategy because of QoS reasons (quality)\nIt should be expected that creating and posting the QoS message is\nreasonably fast and does not significantly contribute to the QoS\nproblems. Options to disable this feature could also be presented on\nelements.\nThis message can be posted by a sink/src that performs synchronisation\nagainst the clock (live) or it could be posted by an upstream element\nthat performs QoS because of QOS events received from a downstream\nelement (!live).\nThe GST_MESSAGE_QOS contains at least the following info:\nlive: G_TYPE_BOOLEAN: If the QoS message was dropped by a live\nelement such as a sink or a live source. If the live property is\nFALSE, the QoS message was generated as a response to a QoS event in\na non-live element.\nrunning-time: G_TYPE_UINT64: The running_time of the buffer that\ngenerated the QoS message.\nstream-time: G_TYPE_UINT64: The stream_time of the buffer that\ngenerated the QoS message.\ntimestamp: G_TYPE_UINT64: The timestamp of the buffer that\ngenerated the QoS message.\nduration: G_TYPE_UINT64: The duration of the buffer that generated\nthe QoS message.\njitter: G_TYPE_INT64: The difference of the running-time against\nthe deadline. Negative values mean the timestamp was on time.\nPositive values indicate the timestamp was late (and dropped) by\nthat amount. The deadline can be a realtime running_time or an\nestimated running_time.\nproportion: G_TYPE_DOUBLE: Long term prediction of the ideal rate\nrelative to normal rate to get optimal quality.\nquality: G_TYPE_INT: An element dependent integer value that\nspecifies the current quality level of the element. The default\nmaximum quality is 1000000.\nformat: GST_TYPE_FORMAT Units of the processed and dropped\nfields. Video sinks and video filters will use GST_FORMAT_BUFFERS\n(frames). Audio sinks and audio filters will likely use\nGST_FORMAT_DEFAULT (samples).\nprocessed: G_TYPE_UINT64: Total number of units correctly\nprocessed since the last state change to READY or a flushing\noperation.\ndropped: G_TYPE_UINT64: Total number of units dropped since the\nlast state change to READY or a flushing operation.\nThe running-time and processed fields can be used to estimate the\naverage processing rate (framerate for video).\nElements might add additional fields in the message which are documented\nin the relevant elements or baseclasses.\n\n\ndrop a buffer because of QoS reasons\n\n\nchange its processing strategy because of QoS reasons (quality)\n\n\n\n\nlive: G_TYPE_BOOLEAN: If the QoS message was dropped by a live\nelement such as a sink or a live source.
