Users are still\nexpected to listen to about-to-finish and set the next URI to play back.\nOne thing that needs to be taken care of is making sure we don't emit\nabout-to-finish for play items which aren't currently used. This would end up\nin a situation where about-to-finish would cause a snowball effect of pending\nplay items emitting it, which would cause a future entry to be created,\nprerolled and emitting it again.\nFor that reason, if a play item emits that signal but isn't the input or output\nplay item, then it is just stored and not propagated upstream. When that play\nentry becomes the new input entry it will be propagated.\n"});
