fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/dmabuf.html#file-descriptor","fragment":"File descriptor\nEach file descriptor represents a chunk of a frame, usually a plane. For\nexample, when a DMA buffer contains NV12 format data, it might be\ncomposited by 2 planes: one for its Y component and the other for both UV\ncomponents. Then, the hardware may use two detached memory chunks, one per\nplane, exposed as two file descriptors. Otherwise, if hardware uses only\none continuous memory chunk for all the planes, the DMA buffer should just\nhave one file descriptor.\n"});
