On DVDs, there may be a 4:3 version and a 16:9\nversion of the same subtitles. We could attach both variants and let\nthe renderer pick the best one for the situation (currently we just\nuse the 16:9 version). With totem, it's ultimately totem that adds\nthe 'black bars' at the top/bottom, so totem also knows if it's got\na 4:3 display and can/wants to fit 4:3 subs (which may render on top\nof the bars) or not, for example.\n\n"});
