fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/segments.html#segments","fragment":"Segments\nA segment in GStreamer denotes a set of media samples that must be\nprocessed. A segment has a start time, a stop time and a processing\nrate.\nA media stream has a start and a stop time. The start time is always 0\nand the stop time is the total duration (or -1 if unknown, for example a\nlive stream). We call this the complete media stream.\nThe segment of the complete media stream can be played by issuing a seek\non the stream. The seek has a start time, a stop time and a processing\nrate.\nThe playback of a segment starts with a source or demuxer element\npushing a SEGMENT event containing the start time, stop time and rate of\nthe segment. The purpose of this event is to inform downstream\nelements of the requested segment positions. Some elements might produce\nbuffers that fall outside of the segment and that might therefore be\ndiscarded or clipped.\n"});
