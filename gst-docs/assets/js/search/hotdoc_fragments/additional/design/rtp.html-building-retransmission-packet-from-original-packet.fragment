fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/rtp.html#building-retransmission-packet-from-original-packet","fragment":"Building retransmission packet from original packet\nAn rtx packet is mostly the same as an orignal packet, except it has its\nown ssrc and its own seqnum. That's why rtprtxsend works in\nSSRC-multiplexed mode. It also means that the same session is used.\nAnother difference between an rtx packet and its original is that it\ninserts the original seqnum (OSN: 2 bytes) at the beginning of the\npayload. Also rtprtxsend builds rtx packet without padding, to let other\nelements do that. The last difference is the payload type. For now the\nuser has to set it through the rtx-payload-type property. Later it will\nautomatically retreive this information from SDP. See fmtp field as\nspecified in RFC 4588 (a=fmtp:99 apt=98): fmtp is the payload type of\nthe retransmission stream and apt the payload type of its associated\nmaster stream.\n"});
