If parsers are needed/present they are placed before the\nmultiqueue. This is needed in order for multiqueue to work only with packetized\nand properly timestamped streams.\nNote that the whole typefinding of streams, and optional depayloading, demuxing\nand parsing are done in a new parsebin element.\nJust like the current implementation, demuxers will expose all streams present\nwithin a program as source pads. They will connect to parsers and multiqueue.\nInitial setup. 1 video stream, 2 audio streams.\n\nit will only expose as output ghost source pads one stream of each type (one\naudio, one video, ..).\nIt will only decode the exposed streams\n\n"});
