It is commonly done while pre-rolling,\nbut can also happen whenever a new pad appears on any element.\nOnce a target caps has been found, that pad is ghosted and the\n'pad-added' signal is emitted.\nIf no compatible elements can be found for a GstCaps, the pad is ghosted\nand the 'unknown-type' signal is emitted.\n"});
