fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/meta.html#transformations","fragment":"Transformations\nAfter certain transformations, the metadata on a buffer might not be\nrelevant anymore.\nConsider, for example, metadata that lists certain regions of interest\non the video data. If the video is scaled or rotated, the coordinates\nmight not make sense anymore. A transform element should be able to\nadjust or remove the associated metadata when it becomes invalid.\nWe can make the transform element aware of the metadata so that it can\nadjust or remove in an intelligent way. Since we allow arbitrary\nmetadata, we canâ€™t do this for all metadata and thus we need some other\nway.\nOne proposition is to tag the metadata type with keywords that specify\nwhat it functionally refers too. We could, for example, tag the metadata\nfor the regions of interest with a tag that notes that the metadata\nrefers to absolute pixel positions. A transform could then know that the\nmetadata is not valid anymore when the position of the pixels changed\n(due to rotation, flipping, scaling and so on).\n"});
