If the event function returns success, the sticky event is\nstored in the sticky event array and the event is marked for update.\nWhen the pad is flushing, the gst_pad_send_event() function returns FALSE\nimmediately.\nWhen the next data item is pushed, the pending events are pushed first.\nThis ensures that the event function is never called for flushing pads\nand that the sticky array only contains events for which the event\nfunction returned success.\n"});
