fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/gstbin.html#gstbus","fragment":"GstBus\nThe GstBin creates a GstBus for its children and distributes it when\nchild elements are added to the bin. The bin attaches a sync handler to\nreceive messages from children. The bus for receiving messages from\nchildren is distinct from the bin’s own externally-visible GstBus.\nMessages received from children are forwarded intact onto the bin’s\nexternal message bus, except for EOS and SEGMENT_START/DONE which are\nhandled specially.\nASYNC_START/ASYNC_STOP messages received from the children are used to\ntrigger a recalculation of the current state of the bin, as described in\nstates.\nThe application can retrieve the external GstBus and integrate it in the\nmainloop or it can just pop() messages off in its own thread.\nWhen a bin goes to READY it will clear all cached messages.\n"});
