For example, every time the SCR in MPEG data\nadvances more than 0.5 seconds, the MPEG demuxer can issue a SEGMENT with\n(update=TRUE, start=SCR ). Downstream elements can then be aware not to\nexpect any data older than the new start time.\nThe same holds true for any element that knows the current position in the\nstream - once the element knows that there is no more data to be presented\nuntil time 'n' it can advance the start time of the current segment to 'n'.\nThis technique can also be used, for example, to represent a stream of\nMIDI events spaced to a clock period. When there is no event present for\na clock time, a SEGMENT update can be sent in its place.\n"});
