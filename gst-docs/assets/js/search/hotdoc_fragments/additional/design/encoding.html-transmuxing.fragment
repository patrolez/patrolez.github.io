fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/encoding.html#transmuxing","fragment":"Transmuxing\nGiven a certain file, the aim is to remux the contents WITHOUT decoding\ninto either a different container format or the same container format.\nRemuxing into the same container format is useful when the file was not\ncreated properly (for example, the index is missing). Whenever\navailable, parsers should be applied on the encoded streams to validate\nand/or fix the streams before muxing them.\nMetadata from the original file must be kept in the newly created file.\nExample applications: Arista, Transmaggedon\n"});
