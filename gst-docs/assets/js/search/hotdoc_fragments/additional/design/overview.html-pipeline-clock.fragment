fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/overview.html#pipeline-clock","fragment":"Pipeline clock\nOne of the important functions of the pipeline is to select a global\nclock for all the elements in the pipeline.\nThe purpose of the clock is to provide a stricly increasing value at the\nrate of one GST_SECOND per second. Clock values are expressed in\nnanoseconds. Elements use the clock time to synchronize the playback of\ndata.\nBefore the pipeline is set to PLAYING, the pipeline asks each element if\nthey can provide a clock. The clock is selected in the following order:\nIf the application selected a clock, use that one.\nIf a source element provides a clock, use that clock.\nSelect a clock from any other element that provides a clock, start\nwith the sinks.\nIf no element provides a clock a default system clock is used for\nthe pipeline.\nIn a typical playback pipeline this algorithm will select the clock\nprovided by a sink element such as an audio sink.\nIn capture pipelines, this will typically select the clock of the data\nproducer, which in most cases can not control the rate at which it\nproduces data.\n\n\nIf the application selected a clock, use that one.\n\n\nIf a source element provides a clock, use that clock.\n\n\nSelect a clock from any other element that provides a clock, start\nwith the sinks.\n\n\nIf no element provides a clock a default system clock is used for\nthe pipeline.\n\n\n"});
