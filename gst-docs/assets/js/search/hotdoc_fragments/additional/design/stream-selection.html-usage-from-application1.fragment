fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stream-selection.html#usage-from-application1","fragment":"Usage from application\nThere are two use-cases where an application needs to specify in a generic\nfashion which streams it wants in output:\nWhen there are several present streams of which it only wants a subset (such\nas one audio, one video and one subtitle stream). Those streams are demuxed\nand present in the pipeline.\nWhen the stream the user wants require some element to undertake some action\nto expose that stream in the pipeline (such as DASH/HLS alternative streams).\nFrom the point of view of the application, those two use-cases are treated\nidentically.  The streams are all available through the GstStreamCollection\nposted on the bus, and the applications selects a subset.\nThe application can select the streams it wants by creating a\nGST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS event with the list of stream-id of the streams it\nwants. That event is then sent on the pipeline, eventually traveling all the way\nupstream from each sink.\nIn some cases, selecting one stream may trigger the availability of other\ndependent streams, resulting in new GstStreamCollection messages. This can\nhappen in the case where choosing a different DVB channel would create a new\nsingle-program collection.\n"});
