fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/seeking.html#gst_seek_flag_accurate","fragment":"GST_SEEK_FLAG_ACCURATE\nIf the ACCURATE flag is specified in a seek request, the demuxer/parser\nis asked to do whatever it takes (!) to make sure the position\nseeked to is accurate in relation to the beginning of the stream. This\nmeans that it is not acceptable to just approximate the position (e.g.\nusing an average bitrate). The achieved position must be exact. In the\nworst case, the demuxer or parser needs to push data from the beginning\nof the file and let downstream clip everything before the requested\nsegment start.\nThe ACCURATE flag does not affect what the segment start should be in\nrelation to the requested seek position. Only the KEY_UNIT flag (or its\nabsence) has any effect on that.\nVideo editors and frame-stepping applications usually use the ACCURATE\nflag.\n"});
