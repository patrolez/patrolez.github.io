fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/preroll.html#preroll","fragment":"Preroll\nA sink element can only complete the state change to PAUSED after a\nbuffer has been queued on the input pad or pads. This process is called\nprerolling and is needed to fill the pipeline with buffers so that the\ntransition to PLAYING goes as fast as possible, with no visual delay for\nthe user.\nPreroll is also crucial in maintaining correct audio and video\nsynchronisation and ensuring that no buffers are dropped in the sinks.\nAfter receiving a buffer (or EOS) on a pad the chain/event function\nshould wait to render the buffers or in the EOS case, wait to post the\nEOS message. While waiting, the sink will wait for the preroll cond to\nbe signalled.\nSeveral things can happen that require the preroll cond to be signalled.\nThese include state changes or flush events. The prerolling is\nimplemented in sinks (see Sink elements).\n"});
