fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/opengl.html#platform-specifics","fragment":"Platform Specifics\nDue to the nature of OpenGL, the use of OpenGL requires a connection to a\nwindowing system (X11, Wayland, Cocoa, GDI+, etc).  These windowing systems\nare entirely platform specific and are wrapped in the GstGLDisplay generic\ninterface.  Specific functionality exposed by a windowing system may be exposed\nby platform-specific GstGLDisplay objects.  e.g. GstGLDisplayWayland or\nGstGLDisplayX11.\nAnother platform specific part of the puzzle is the GstGLWindow object which\nencapsulates the surface that is being rendered into by OpenGL.  There are\nspecific windowing system implementations for each platform that are all exposed\nthrough the generic GstGLWindow interface.  An application generally does not\nneed to interact with the window used by an OpenGL context with GStreamer.\nThe last platform specific piece is the GstGLContext which represents a\nOpenGL context.  A GstGLContext has two main forms, wrapped (created with\ngst_gl_context_new_wrapped()) vs not.  Some GstGLContext API behaves\ndifferently with a wrapped GstGLContext.\n"});
