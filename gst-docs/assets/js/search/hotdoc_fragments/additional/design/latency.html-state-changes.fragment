fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/latency.html#state-changes","fragment":"State Changes\nA sink is never set to PLAYING before it is prerolled. In order to do\nthis, the pipeline (at the GstBin level) keeps track of all elements\nthat require preroll (the ones that return ASYNC from the state change).\nThese elements posted an ASYNC_START message without a matching\nASYNC_DONE one.\nThe pipeline will not change the state of the elements that are still\ndoing an ASYNC state change.\nWhen an ASYNC element prerolls, it commits its state to PAUSED and posts\nan ASYNC_DONE message. The pipeline notices this ASYNC_DONE message\nand matches it with the ASYNC_START message it cached for the\ncorresponding element.\nWhen all ASYNC_START messages are matched with an ASYNC_DONE message,\nthe pipeline proceeds with setting the elements to the final state\nagain.\nThe base time of the element was already set by the pipeline when it\nchanged the NO_PREROLL element to PLAYING. This operation has to be\nperformed in the separate async state change thread (like the one\ncurrently used for going from PAUSEDâ†’PLAYING in a non-live pipeline).\n"});
