fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stream-selection.html#usage-from-elements","fragment":"Usage from elements\nWhen a demuxer knows the list of streams it can expose, it creates a new\nGstStream for each stream it can provide with the appropriate information\n(stream id, flag, tags, caps, ...).\nThe demuxer then creates a GstStreamCollection object in which it will put the\nlist of GstStream it can expose.  That collection is then both posted on the\nbus (via a GST_MESSAGE_COLLECTION) and on each pad (via a\nGST_EVENT_STREAM_COLLECTION).\nThat new collection must be posted on the bus before the changes are made\navailable. i.e. before pads corresponding to that selection are added/removed.\nIf an element can handle selecting a sub-set of those streams (for example a\nHLS/DASH demuxer which only download the required streams), it can inform\ndownstream elements by answer the GST_QUERY_SELECTABLE with TRUE. It should\ntherefore be able to handle GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS at any point in time\n(including while posting the initial collection on the bus).\nIn order to be backwards-compatible and support elements that don't create\nstreams/collection yet, the parsebin element (used by decodebin3) will\nautomatically create the stream and collection if not provided by the elements\nwithin.\n"});
