fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/miniobject.html#exclusive-counter","fragment":"exclusive counter\nEach object that wants to keep a reference to a GstMiniObject and doesn't\nwant to see the changes from other owners of the same GstMiniObject needs to\nlock the GstMiniObject in EXCLUSIVE mode, which will increase the exclusive\ncounter.\nThe exclusive counter counts the amount of objects that share this\nGstMiniObject. The counter is initially 0, meaning that the object is not\nshared with any object.\nWhen a reference to a GstMiniObject release, both the ref count and the\nexclusive counter will be decreased with gst_mini_object_unref() and\ngst_mini_object_unlock() respectively.\n"});
