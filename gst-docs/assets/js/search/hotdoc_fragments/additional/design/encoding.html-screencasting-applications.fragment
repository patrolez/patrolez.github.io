The difference being that\ndue to the nature of the source (size and amount/frequency of updates)\none might want to do the encoding in two parts: * The actual live\ncapture is encoded with a 'almost-lossless' codec (such as huffyuv) *\nOnce the capture is done, the file created in the first step is then\nrendered to the desired target format.\nFixing sources to only emit region-updates and having encoders capable\nof encoding those streams would fix the need for the first step but is\noutside of the scope of encodebin.\nExample applications: Istanbul, gnome-shell, recordmydesktop\n"});
