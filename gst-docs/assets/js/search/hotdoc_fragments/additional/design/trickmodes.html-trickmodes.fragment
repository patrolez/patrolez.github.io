This\nincludes:\nserver side trickmodes\nclient side fast/slow forward playback\nclient side fast/slow backwards playback\nServer side trickmodes mean that a source (network source) can provide a\nstream with different playback speed and direction. The client does not\nhave to perform any special algorithms to decode this stream.\nClient side trickmodes mean that the decoding client (GStreamer)\nperforms the needed algorithms to change the direction and speed of the\nmedia file.\nSeeking can both be done in a playback pipeline and a transcoding\npipeline.\n\n\nserver side trickmodes\n\n\nclient side fast/slow forward playback\n\n\nclient side fast/slow backwards playback\n\n\n"});
