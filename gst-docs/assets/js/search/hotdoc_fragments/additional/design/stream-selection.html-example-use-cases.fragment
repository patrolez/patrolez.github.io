The pipeline will need to reconfigure to play the desired streams\nfrom new program. Equally, there may be multiple seconds of content buffered\nfrom the old program and it should still be possible to switch (for example)\nsubtitle tracks responsively in the draining out data, as well as selecting\nwhich subs track to play from the new feed.\nThis same scenario applies when doing gapless transition to a new source\nfile/URL, except that likely the element providing the list of streams also\nchanges as a new demuxer is installed.\nWhen playing a multi-angle DVD, the DVD Virtual Machine needs to extract 1\nangle from the data for presentation. It can publish the available angles as\nlogical streams, even though only one stream can be chosen.\nWhen playing a DVD, the user can make stream selections from the DVD menu to\nchoose audio or sub-picture tracks, or the DVD VM can trigger automatic\nselections.\nIn addition, the player UI should be able to show which audio/subtitle tracks\nare available and allow direct selection in a GUI the same as for normal\nfiles with subtitle tracks in them.\nPlaying a SCHC (3DTV) feed, where one view is MPEG-2 and the other is H.264\nand they should be combined for 3D presentation, or not bother decoding 1\nstream if displaying 2D.  (bug\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/issues/118)\nPlaying an adaptive stream (HLS or DASH), the user can know the various\nstreams it can select, and only the required streams will be downloaded. This\nis independent of the bitrate selection mechanism.\n"});
