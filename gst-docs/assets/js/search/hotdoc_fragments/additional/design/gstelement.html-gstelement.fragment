fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/gstelement.html#gstelement","fragment":"GstElement\nThe GstElement is the most important object in the entire GStreamer system,\nas it defines the structure of the pipeline. Elements include: sources,\nfilters, sinks, and containers (Bins). They may be an intrinsic part of\nthe core GStreamer library, or may be loaded from a plugin. In some\ncases theyâ€™re even fabricated from completely different systems (see the\nLADSPA plugin). Elements are generally created from a GstElementFactory,\nwhich will be covered in another chapter, but for the intrinsic types\nthey can be created with specific functions.\nElements contain GstPads (also covered in another chapter), which are\nsubsequently used to connect the Elements together to form a pipeline\ncapable of passing and processing data. They have a parent, which must\nbe another Element. This allows deeply nested pipelines, and the\npossibility of \"black-box\" meta-elements.\n"});
