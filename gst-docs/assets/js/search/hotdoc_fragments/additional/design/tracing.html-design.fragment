Developers will be able to select a list of\nplugins by setting an environment variable, such as\nGST_TRACERS=\"meminfo;dbus\". One can also pass parameters to plugins, e.g:\nWhen then plugins are loaded, weâ€™ll add them to certain hooks according to\nwhich they are interested in.\nRight now tracing info is logged as GstStructures to the TRACE level.\nIdea: Another env var GST_TRACE_CHANNEL could be used to send the\ntracing to a file or a socket. See\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=733188 for discussion on\nthese environment variables.\n"});
