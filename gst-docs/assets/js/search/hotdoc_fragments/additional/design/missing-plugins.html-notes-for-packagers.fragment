Examples of these are pitfdll,\nladspa, or the GStreamer libvisual plugin. Those plugins will only\nannounce elements for the currently installed external plugins at\nthe time of introspection! With the exception of pitfdll, this is\nnot really relevant to the playback case, but may become an issue in\nfuture when applications like buzztard, jokosher or pitivi start\nrequestion elements by name, for example ladspa effect elements or\nso.\nThis case could be handled if those wrapper plugins would also provide a\ngst-install-xxx-plugins-helper, where xxx={ladspa|visual|...}. Thus if the\ndistro specific gst-install-plugins-helper can't resolve a request for e.g.\nelement-bml-sonicverb it can forward the request to\ngst-install-bml-plugins-helper (bml is the buzz machine loader).\n"});
