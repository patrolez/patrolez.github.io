fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/interlaced-video.html#alternate-fields","fragment":"Alternate fields\nSince: 1.16\nIf the video info interlace mode is \"alternate\", then each buffer\ncarries a single field of interlaced video.\nGST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_TOP_FIELD and GST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_BOTTOM_FIELD\nindicate whether the buffer carries a top or bottom field. The order of\nbuffers/fields in the stream and the timestamps on the buffers indicate the\ntemporal order of the fields.\nTop and bottom fields are expected to alternate in this mode.\nCaps for this interlace mode must also carry a format:Interlaced caps feature\n(GST_CAPS_FEATURE_FORMAT_INTERLACED) to ensure backwards compatibility for\nthe new mode.\nThe frame rate in the caps still signals the frame rate, so the notional field\nrate will be twice the frame rate from the caps (see GST_VIDEO_INFO_FIELD_RATE_N).\nIn the same vein the width and height in the caps will indicate frame\ndimensions not field dimensions, meaning the height of the video data inside\nthe buffers (1 field) will be half of the height in the caps.\n"});
