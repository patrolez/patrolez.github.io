fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/bufferpool.html#downstream","fragment":"Downstream\nWhen the upstream element wants to negotiate a new format, it might need\nto renegotiate a new bufferpool configuration with the downstream element.\nThis can, for example, happen when the buffer size changes.\nWe can not just reconfigure the existing bufferpool because there might\nstill be outstanding buffers from the pool in the pipeline. Therefore we\nneed to create a new bufferpool for the new configuration while we let the\nold pool drain.\nImplementations can choose to reuse the same bufferpool object and wait for\nthe drain to finish before reconfiguring the pool.\nThe element that wants to renegotiate a new bufferpool uses exactly the same\nalgorithm as when it first started. It will negotiate caps first then use the\nALLOCATION query to get and configure the new pool.\n"});
