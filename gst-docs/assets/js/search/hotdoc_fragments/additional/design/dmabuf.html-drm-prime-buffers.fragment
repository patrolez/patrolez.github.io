These are the ones normally used in GStreamer which might\ncontain video frames.\nPRIME buffers requires some metadata to describe how to interpret them,\nsuch as a set of file descriptors (for example, one per plane), color\ndefinition in fourcc, and DRM-modifiers. If the frame is going to be mapped\nonto system's memory, also is needed padding, strides, offsets, etc.\n"});
