fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/MT-refcounting.html#object-locking","fragment":"Object locking:\nFor objects that contain state information and generally have a longer\nlifetime, object locking is used to update the information contained in the\nobject.\nAll readers and writers acquire the lock before accessing the object. Only one\nthread is allowed access the protected structures at a time.\nObject locking is used for all objects extending from GstObject such as\nGstElement, GstPad.\nObject locking can be done with recursive locks or regular mutexes. Object\nlocks in GStreamer are implemented with mutexes which cause deadlocks when\nlocked recursively from the same thread. This is done because regular mutexes\nare cheaper.\n"});
