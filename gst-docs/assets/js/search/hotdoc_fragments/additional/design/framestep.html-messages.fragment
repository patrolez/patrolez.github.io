It contains the following\nfields.\nactive: If the step was queued or activated.\nformat GST_TYPE_FORMAT: The format of the step units that queued/activated.\namount G_TYPE_UINT64: The amount of units that were queued/activated.\nrate G_TYPE_DOUBLE: The rate and direction at which the frames were queued/activated.\nflush G_TYPE_BOOLEAN: If the queued/activated frames will be flushed.\nintermediate G_TYPE_BOOLEAN: If this is an intermediate step operation\nthat queued/activated.\nThe STEP_START message is emitted 2 times:\nfirst when an element received the STEP event and queued it. The\n\"active\" field will be FALSE in this case.\nsecond when the step operation started in the streaming thread. The\n\"active\" field is TRUE in this case. After this message is emitted,\nthe application can queue a new step operation.\nThe purpose of this message is to find out how many elements participate\nin the step operation and to queue new step operations at the earliest\npossible moment.\nA new GST_MESSAGE_STEP_DONE message is created. It contains the\nfollowing fields:\nThe message is emitted by the element that performs the step operation.\nThe purpose is to return the duration in GST_FORMAT_TIME of the\nstepped media. This especially interesting to align other stream in case\nof stepping frames on the video sink element.\n\n\nactive: If the step was queued or activated.\n\n\nformat GST_TYPE_FORMAT: The format of the step units that queued/activated.\n\n\namount G_TYPE_UINT64: The amount of units that were queued/activated.\n\n\nrate G_TYPE_DOUBLE: The rate and direction at which the frames were queued/activated.\n\n\nflush G_TYPE_BOOLEAN: If the queued/activated frames will be flushed.\n\n\nintermediate G_TYPE_BOOLEAN: If this is an intermediate step operation\nthat queued/activated.\n\n\n\n\nfirst when an element received the STEP event and queued it.
