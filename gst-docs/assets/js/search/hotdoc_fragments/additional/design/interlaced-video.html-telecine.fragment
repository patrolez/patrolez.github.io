For example, in a sequence of three telecined\nframes, we might have:\nIn this situation, we only need the first and third buffers as the\nsecond buffer contains fields present in the first and third.\nNote that the following state can have its second buffer identified\nusing the ONEFIELD flag (and TFF not set):\nThe telecine state requires one additional flag to be able to identify\nprogressive buffers.\nThe presence of the GST_VIDEO_BUFFER_FLAG_INTERLACED means that the\nbuffer is an 'interlaced' or 'mixed' buffer that contains two fields\nthat, when combined with fields from adjacent buffers, allow\nreconstruction of progressive frames. The absence of the flag implies\nthe buffer containing two fields is a progressive frame.\nFor example in the following sequence, the third buffer would be mixed\n(yes, it is a strange pattern, but it can happen):\n"});
