If new sink pads are\nrequired they will be requested, and if old pads are no longer needed (for\nexample switching from two streams to a single one) they will be removed.\nNote: Doing this also has the benefit that \"replacing\" the inputs to\ndecodebin3 are done from a new streaming thread, and not the old\nurisourcebin streaming thread which could cause deadlocks.\nNote: This \"waiting\" is only done when \"switching\", i.e. on sources which\naren't in the current input play item. If the pads are from the current play\nentry they are linked/unlinked as soon as they are added/removed.\nThe moment at which the next play item is pre-rolled is done:\nWhen the current play item has posted about-to-finish and the\nuser/application has set a new play item.\nWhen a new play item has been set and the instant-uri property has been set\nto TRUE.\nWhen a play item is pre-rolled, it is marked as \"active\". There can only be one\n\"active\" play item in addition to the input play item.\n\n\nWhen the current play item has posted about-to-finish and the\nuser/application has set a new play item.\n\n\nWhen a new play item has been set and the instant-uri property has been set\nto TRUE.\n\n\n"});
