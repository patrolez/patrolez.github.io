fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/buffering.html#application","fragment":"Application\nWhile data is buffered the pipeline should remain in the PAUSED state.\nIt is also possible that more data should be buffered while the pipeline\nis PLAYING, in which case the pipeline should be PAUSED until the\nbuffering finishes.\nBUFFERING messages can be posted while the pipeline is prerolling. The\napplication should not set the pipeline to PLAYING before a BUFFERING\nmessage with a 100 percent value is received, which might only happen\nafter the pipeline prerolls.\nAn exception is made for live pipelines. The application may not change\nthe state of a live pipeline when a buffering message is received.\nUsually these buffering messages contain the \"buffering-mode\" = \"live\".\nThe buffering message can also instruct the application to switch to a\nperiodical BUFFERING query instead, so it can more precisely control the\nbuffering process. The application can, for example, choose not to act\non the BUFFERING complete message (buffer-percent = 100) to resume\nplayback but use the estimated download time instead, resuming playback\nwhen it has determined that it should be able to provide uninterrupted\nplayback.\n"});
