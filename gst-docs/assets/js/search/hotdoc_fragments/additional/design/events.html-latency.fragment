fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/events.html#latency","fragment":"LATENCY\nA latency event is used to configure a certain latency in the pipeline.\nIt contains a single GstClockTime with the required latency. The latency\nvalue is calculated by the pipeline and distributed to all sink elements\nbefore they are set to PLAYING. The sinks will add the configured\nlatency value to the timestamps of the buffer in order to delay their\npresentation. (See also latency).\n"});
