fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/buffer.html#generating-rtp-packets-from-h264-video","fragment":"Generating RTP packets from h264 video\nWe receive as input a GstBuffer with an encoded h264 image and we need\nto create RTP packets containing this h264 data as the payload. We\ntypically need to fragment the h264 data into multiple packets, each\nwith their own RTP and payload specific header.\nThe output buffer array consists of x buffers consisting of an RTP\npayload header and a subbuffer of the original input H264 buffer. Since\nthe rtp headers and the h264 data donâ€™t need to be contiguous in memory,\nthey are added to the buffer as separate GstMemory blocks and we can\navoid to memcpy the h264 data into contiguous memory.\nA typical udpsink will then use something like sendmsg to send the\nmemory regions on the network inside one UDP packet. This will further\navoid having to memcpy data into contiguous memory.\nUsing bufferlists, the complete array of output buffers can be pushed in\none operation to the peer element.\n"});
