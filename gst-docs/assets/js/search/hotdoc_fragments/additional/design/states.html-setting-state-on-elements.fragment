fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/states.html#setting-state-on-elements","fragment":"Setting state on elements\nThe state of an element can be changed with _element_set_state().\nWhen changing the state of an element all intermediate states will also\nbe set on the element until the final desired state is set.\nThe set_state() function can return 3 possible values:\nGST_STATE_FAILURE: The state change failed for some reason. The plugin should have posted an error message on the bus with information.\nGST_STATE_SUCCESS: The state change is completed successfully.\nGST_STATE_ASYNC: The state change will complete later on. This can happen\nwhen the element needs a long time to perform the state change or for sinks\nthat need to receive the first buffer before they can complete the state change\n(preroll).\nGST_STATE_NO_PREROLL: The state change is completed successfully but the\nelement will not be able to produce data in the PAUSED state.\nIn the case of an ASYNC state change, it is possible to proceed to the\nnext state before the current state change completes, however, the\nelement will only get to this next state before completing the previous\nASYNC state change. After receiving an ASYNC return value, you can use\nelement_get_state() to poll the status of the element. If the\npolling returns SUCCESS, the element completed the state change to the\nlast requested state with set_state().\nWhen setting the state of an element, the STATE_PENDING is set to the\nrequired state. Then the state change function of the element is called\nand the result of that function is used to update the STATE and\nSTATE_RETURN fields, STATE_NEXT, STATE_PENDING and STATE_RETURN\nfields. If the function returned ASYNC, this result is immediately\nreturned to the caller.\n\n\nGST_STATE_FAILURE: The state change failed for some reason. The plugin should have posted an error message on the bus with information.\n\n\nGST_STATE_SUCCESS: The state change is completed successfully.\n\n\nGST_STATE_ASYNC: The state change will complete later on. This can happen\nwhen the element needs a long time to perform the state change or for sinks\nthat need to receive the first buffer before they can complete the state change\n(preroll).\n\n\nGST_STATE_NO_PREROLL: The state change is completed successfully but the\nelement will not be able to produce data in the PAUSED state.\n\n\n"});
