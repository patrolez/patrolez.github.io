This value is called the absolute_time. A GstClock\nalways counts time upwards and does not necessarily start at 0.\nDifferent sources exist for this counter:\nthe system time (with g_get_current_time() and with microsecond\naccuracy)\nmonotonic time (with g_get_monotonic_time() with microsecond\naccuracy)\nan audio device (based on number of samples played)\na network source based on packets received + timestamps in those\npackets (a typical example is an RTP source)\n…\nIn GStreamer any element can provide a GstClock object that can be used\nin the pipeline. The GstPipeline object will select a clock from all the\nproviders and will distribute it to all other elements (see\ngstpipeline).\nWhile it is possible, it is not recommended to create a clock derived\nfrom the contents of a stream (for example, create a clock from the PCR\nin an mpeg-ts stream).\n\n\nthe system time (with g_get_current_time() and with microsecond\naccuracy)\n\n\nmonotonic time (with g_get_monotonic_time() with microsecond\naccuracy)\n\n\nan audio device (based on number of samples played)\n\n\na network source based on packets received + timestamps in those\npackets (a typical example is an RTP source)\n\n\n…\n\n\n"});
