A typical codec can for example skip the decoding\nof B-frames to reduce the CPU usage and framerate.\nIf each frame is independantly decodable, any arbitrary frame can be\nskipped based on the timestamp and jitter values of the latest QoS\nevent. In addition can the proportion member be used to permanently skip\nframes.\nIt is suggested to adjust the quality field of the QoS message with the\nexpected amount of dropped frames (skipping B and/or P frames). This\ndepends on the particular spacing of B and P frames in the stream. If\nthe quality control would result in half of the frames to be dropped\n(typical B frame skipping), the quality field would be set to 1000000 * 1/2 = 500000. If a typical I frame spacing of 18 frames is used,\nskipping B and P frames would result in 17 dropped frames or 1 decoded\nframe every 18 frames. The quality member should be set to 1000000 * 1/18 = 55555.\nskipping B frames: quality = 500000\nskipping P/B frames: quality = 55555 (for I-frame spacing of 18\nframes)\n\n\nskipping B frames: quality = 500000\n\n\nskipping P/B frames: quality = 55555 (for I-frame spacing of 18\nframes)\n\n\n"});
