fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/qos.html#long-term-correction","fragment":"Long term correction\nThe datarate used to calculate (5) for the short term prediction is\nbased on a single observation. A more accurate datarate can be obtained\nby creating a running average over multiple datarate observations.\nThis average is less susceptible to sudden changes that would only\ninfluence the datarate for a very short period.\nA running average is calculated over the observations given in (4) and\nis used as the proportion member in the QoS event that is sent upstream.\nReceivers of the QoS event should permanently reduce their datarate as\ngiven by the proportion member. Failure to do so will certainly lead to\nmore dropped frames and a generally worse QoS.\n"});
