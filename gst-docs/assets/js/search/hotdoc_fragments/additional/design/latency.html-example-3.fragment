fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/latency.html#example-3","fragment":"Example 3\nAn example of the combination of a non-live (file) and a live source (vsrc)\nconnected to live sinks (vsink, sink).\nThe state changes happen in the same way as example 1. Except sink will be\nable to preroll (commit its state to PAUSED).\nIn this case sink will have no latency but vsink will. The total latency\nshould be that of vsink.\nNote that because of the presence of a live source (vsrc), the pipeline can be\nset to playing before the sink is able to preroll. Without compensation for the\nlive source, this might lead to synchronisation problems because the latency\nshould be configured in the element before it can go to PLAYING.\n"});
