fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/sparsestreams.html#subtitle-streams","fragment":"Sub-title streams\nSub-title information from muxed formats such as\nMatroska or MPEG consist of irregular buffers spaced far apart compared\nto the other streams (audio and video). Since these usually only appear\nwhen someone speaks or some other action in the video/audio needs\ndescribing, they can be anywhere from 1-2 seconds to several minutes\napart. Downstream elements that want to mix sub-titles and video (and muxers)\nhave no way of knowing whether to process a video packet or wait a moment\nfor a corresponding sub-title to be delivered on another pad.\n"});
