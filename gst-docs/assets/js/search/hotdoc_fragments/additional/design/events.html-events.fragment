Some events should\nbe interleaved with the data stream so they require taking the\nSTREAM_LOCK, others donâ€™t.\nDifferent types of events exist to implement various functionalities.\n\n\nGST_EVENT_FLUSH_START: data is to be discarded\n\nGST_EVENT_FLUSH_STOP: data is allowed again\n\nGST_EVENT_CAPS: Format information about the following buffers\n\nGST_EVENT_SEGMENT: Timing information for the following buffers\n\nGST_EVENT_TAG: Stream metadata.\n\nGST_EVENT_BUFFERSIZE: Buffer size requirements. Currently not used yet.\n\nGST_EVENT_SINK_MESSAGE: An event turned into a message by sinks\n\nGST_EVENT_EOS: no more data is to be expected on a pad.\n\nGST_EVENT_QOS: A notification of the quality of service of the stream\n\nGST_EVENT_SEEK: A seek should be performed to a new position in the stream\n\nGST_EVENT_NAVIGATION: A navigation event.\n\nGST_EVENT_LATENCY: Configure the latency in a pipeline\n\nGST_EVENT_STEP: Stepping event\n\nGST_EVENT_RECONFIGURE: stream reconfigure event\n\n"});
