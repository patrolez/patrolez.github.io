fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/trickmodes.html#send-the-seek-event","fragment":"Send the seek event\nSend the new seek event to the pipeline with\ngst_element_send_event().\nBy default the pipeline will send the event to all sink elements. By\ndefault an element will forward the event upstream on all sinkpads.\nElements can modify the format of the seek event. The most common format\nis GST_FORMAT_TIME.\nOne element will actually perform the seek, this is usually the demuxer\nor source element. For more information on how to perform the different\nseek types see seeking.\nFor client side trickmode a SEGMENT event will be sent downstream with\nthe new rate and start/stop positions. All elements prepare themselves\nto handle the rate (see below). The applied rate of the SEGMENT event\nwill be set to 1.0 to indicate that no rate adjustment has been done.\nfor server side trick mode a SEGMENT event is sent downstream with a\nrate of 1.0 and the start/stop positions. The elements will configure\nthemselves for normal playback speed since the server will perform the\nrate conversions. The applied rate will be set to the rate that will be\napplied by the server. This is done to insure that the position\nreporting performed in the sink is aware of the trick mode.\nWhen the seek succeeds, the _send_event() function will return TRUE.\n"});
