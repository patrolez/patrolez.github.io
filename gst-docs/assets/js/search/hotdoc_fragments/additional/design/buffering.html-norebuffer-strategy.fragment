fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/buffering.html#norebuffer-strategy","fragment":"No-rebuffer strategy\nThis strategy tries to buffer as much data as possible so that playback can\ncontinue without any further rebuffering.\nThis strategy is initially similar to simple buffering, the difference is in\ndeciding on the condition to continue playback. When a 100% buffering message\nhas been received, the application will not yet start the playback but it will\nstart a periodic buffering query, which will return the estimated amount of\nbuffering time left. When the estimated time left is less than the remaining\nplayback time, playback can continue.\nThis strategy requires a unlimited buffer size in memory or on disk, such as\nprovided by elements that implement the incremental download buffering mode.\nUsually, the application can choose to start playback even before the\nremaining buffer time elapsed in order to more quickly start the playback at\nthe expense of a possible rebuffering phase.\n"});
