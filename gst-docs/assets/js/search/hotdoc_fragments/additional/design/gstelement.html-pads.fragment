fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/gstelement.html#pads","fragment":"Pads\nGstPads are the property of a given GstElement. They provide the\nconnection capability allowing arbitrary structure in the graph.\nEvery GstElement (with the exception of sources and sinks) have at\nleast 2 GstPads. These pads are stored in a single GList within the\nElement. Several counters are kept in order to allow quicker\ndetermination of the type and properties of a given Element.\nPads may be added to an element with _add_pad(). Retrieval is done via\n_get_static_pad(), which operates on the name of the Pad (the unique\nkey). This means that all Pads owned by a given Element must have unique\nnames. A pointer to the GList of pads may be obtained with\n_iterate_pads().\ngst_element_add_pad(element,pads): Sets the element as the parent of\nthe pad, then adds the pad to the element’s list of pads, keeping the\ncounts of total, src, and sink pads up to date. Emits the new_pad\nsignal with the pad as argument. Fails if either the element or pad are\nNULL or not what they claim to be. Should fail if the pad already\nhas a parent. Should fail if the pad is already owned by the element.\nShould fail if there’s already a pad by that name in the list of pads.\npad = gst_element_get_pad(element, \"padname\"): Searches through the\nlist of pads\n"});
