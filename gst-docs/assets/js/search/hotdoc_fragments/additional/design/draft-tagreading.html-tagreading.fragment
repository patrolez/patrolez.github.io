fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/draft-tagreading.html#tagreading","fragment":"Tagreading\nThe tagreading (metadata reading) use case for mediacenter applications\nis not too well supported by the current GStreamer architecture. It uses\ndemuxers on the files, which generally said takes too long (building\nseek-index, prerolling). What we want is specialized elements / parsing\nmodes that just do the tag-reading.\nThe idea is to define a TagReadIFace. Tag-demuxers, classic demuxers and\ndecoder plugins can just implement the interface or provide a separate\nelement that implements the interface.\nIn addition we need a tagreadbin, that similar to decodebin does a\ntypefind and then plugs the right tagread element(s). If will only look\nat elements that implement the interface. It can plug serval if\npossible.\nFor optimal performance typefind and tagread could share the list of\nalready peeked buffers (a queue element after sink, but that would\nchange pull to push).\n"});
