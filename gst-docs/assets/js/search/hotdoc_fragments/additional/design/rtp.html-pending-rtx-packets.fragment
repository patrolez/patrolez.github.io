Before sending the current master\nstream packet, rtprtxsend sends all the buffers which are in this\nGQueue, taking care of converting them to rtx packets. This way, rtx\npackets are sent in the same order they have been requested.\n(g_list_foreach traverses the queue from head to tail) The GQueue is\ncleared between sending 2 master stream packets. So when this GQueue\ncontains more than one element, it means that rtprtxsend had received more\nthan one rtx request between sending 2 master packets.\n"});
