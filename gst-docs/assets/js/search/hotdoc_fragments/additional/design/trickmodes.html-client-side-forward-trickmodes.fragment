Plugins receiving the SEGMENT can decide\nto perform the rate conversion of the media data (retimestamp video\nframes, resample audio, …).\nIf a plugin decides to resample or retimestamp, it should modify the\nSEGMENT with a rate of 1.0 and update the applied rate so that\ndownstream elements don’t resample again but are aware that the media\nhas been modified.\nThe GStreamer base audio and video sinks will resample automatically if\nthey receive a SEGMENT event with a rate different from 1.0. The\nposition reporting in the base audio and video sinks will also depend on\nthe applied rate of the segment information.\nWhen the SKIP flag is set, frames can be dropped in the elements. If S\nis the speedup factor, a good algorithm for implementing frame skipping\nis to send audio in chunks of Nms (usually 300ms is good) and then skip\n((S-1) * Nns) of audio data. For the video we send only the keyframes\nin the (S * Nns) interval. In this case, the demuxer would scale the\ntimestamps and would set an applied rate of S.\n"});
