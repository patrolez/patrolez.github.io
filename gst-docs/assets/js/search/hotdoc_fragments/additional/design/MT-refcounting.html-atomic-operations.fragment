fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/MT-refcounting.html#atomic-operations","fragment":"Atomic operations\nAtomic operations are operations that are performed as one consistent\noperation even when executed by multiple threads. They do however not use the\nconventional aproach of using mutexes to protect the critical section but rely\non CPU features and instructions.\nThe advantages are mostly speed related since there are no heavyweight locks\ninvolved. Most of these instructions also do not cause a context switch in case\nof concurrent access but use a retry mechanism or spinlocking.\nDisadvantages are that each of these instructions usually cause a cache flush\non multi-CPU machines when two processors perform concurrent access.\nAtomic operations are generally used for refcounting and for the allocation of\nsmall fixed size objects in a memchunk. They can also be used to implement a\nlockfree list or stack.\n"});
