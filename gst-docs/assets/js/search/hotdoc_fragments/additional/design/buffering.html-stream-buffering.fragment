The\nbuffer uses the watermarks as follows:\nThe buffer element will post BUFFERING messages until the high\nwatermark is hit. This instructs the application to keep the\npipeline PAUSED, which will eventually block the srcpad from\npushing while data is prerolled in the sinks.\nWhen the high watermark is hit, a BUFFERING message with 100%\nwill be posted, which instructs the application to continue\nplayback.\nWhen the low watermark is hit during playback, the queue will\nstart posting BUFFERING messages again, making the application\nPAUSE the pipeline again until the high watermark is hit again.\nThis is called the rebuffering stage.\nDuring playback, the queue level will fluctuate between the high\nand low watermarks as a way to compensate for network\nirregularities.\nThis buffering method is usable when the demuxer operates in push mode.\nSeeking in the stream requires the seek to happen in the network source.\nIt is mostly desirable when the total duration of the file is not known, such\nas in live streaming or when efficient seeking is not possible/required.\n\n\nThe buffer element will post BUFFERING messages until the high\nwatermark is hit.
