If it is not possible to timestamp every buffer (filesrc), the source\nis allowed to only timestamp the first buffer (as 0).\nLive sources only produce data in the PLAYING state, when the clock is\nrunning. They should timestamp each buffer they produce with the current\nrunning_time of the pipeline, which is expressed as:\nWith absolute_time being the time obtained from the global pipeline with\ngst_clock_get_time() and base_time being the time of that clock when\nthe pipeline was last set to PLAYING.\n"});
