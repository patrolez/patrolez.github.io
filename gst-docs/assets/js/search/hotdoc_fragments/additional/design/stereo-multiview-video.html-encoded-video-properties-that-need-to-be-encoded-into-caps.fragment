The alternative (not\nproposed) is for the demuxer to switch caps for each mono to not-mono\nchange, and not used a 'mixed' caps variant at all.\n\nsingle refers to a stream of buffers that only contain 1 view.\nIt is different from mono in that the stream is a marked left or right\neye stream for later combining in a mixer or when displaying.\n\nmultiple marks a stream with multiple independent views encoded.\nIt is included in this list for completeness. As noted above, there's\ncurrently no scenario that requires marking encoded buffers as MVC.\n\n\nPossible frame packings: side-by-side, side-by-side-quincunx,\ncolumn-interleaved, row-interleaved, top-bottom, checker-board\nbug 611157 - sreerenj added side-by-side-full and top-bottom-full but\nI think that's covered by suitably adjusting pixel-aspect-ratio. If\nnot, they can be added later.\n\ntop-bottom, side-by-side, column-interleaved, row-interleaved are as the names suggest.\n\nchecker-board, samples are left/right pixels in a chess grid +-+-+-/-+-+-+\n\nside-by-side-quincunx. Side By Side packing, but quincunx sampling -\n1 pixel offset of each eye needs to be accounted when upscaling or displaying\nthere may be other packings (future expansion)\nPossible view sequence orderings: frame-by-frame, frame-primary-secondary-tracks, sequential-row-interleaved\n\nframe-by-frame, each buffer is left, then right view etc\n\nframe-primary-secondary-tracks - the file has 2 video tracks (primary and secondary), one is left eye, one is right.\nDemuxer info indicates which one is which.\nHandling this means marking each stream as all-left and all-right views, decoding separately, and combining automatically (inserting a mixer/combiner in playbin)\n-> Leave this for future expansion\n\n\nsequential-row-interleaved Mentioned by sreerenj in bug patches, I can't find a mention of such a thing. Maybe it's in MPEG-2\n-> Leave this for future expansion / deletion\n\n\n\nDescribes how to decide which piece of each frame corresponds to left or right eye\nPossible orderings left, right, left-then-right, right-then-left\n\n\nNeed to figure out how we find the correct frame in the demuxer to start decoding when seeking in frame-sequential streams\nNeed a buffer flag for marking the first buffer of a group.\n\n\nflags for view specific interpretation\nhorizontal-flip-left, horizontal-flip-right, vertical-flip-left, vertical-flip-right\nIndicates that one or more views has been encoded in a flipped orientation, usually due to camera with mirror or displays with mirrors.\nThis should be an actual flags field. Registered GLib flags types aren't generally well supported in our caps - the type might not be loaded/registered yet when parsing a caps string, so they can't be used in caps templates in the registry.\nIt might be better just to use a hex value / integer\n\n"});
