This clock selection happens when the\npipeline goes to the PLAYING state.\nThe default clock selection algorithm works as follows:\nIf the application selected a clock, use that clock. (see below)\nUse the clock of the most upstream element that can provide one.\nThis selection is performed by iterating the element starting from\nthe sinks going upstream.\nUse GstSystemClock, this only happens when no element provides a\nusable clock.\nThe application can influence this clock selection with two methods:\ngst_pipeline_use_clock() and gst_pipeline_auto_clock().\nThe _use_clock() method forces the use of a specific clock on the\npipeline regardless of what clock providers are available. Passing a\nNULL GstClock *clock parameter to this method disables all clocking\nand makes the pipeline run as fast as possible.\nThe _auto_clock() method removes the fixed clock and reactivates the\nauto- matic clock selection algorithm described above.\n\n\nIf the application selected a clock, use that clock.
