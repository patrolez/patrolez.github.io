Most sources have a limit on the rate at which they can\ndeliver data, which might be faster or slower than the consumption rate.\nThis property however does not make them a live source.\nLet’s look at some example sources.\nfile readers: you can PAUSE without losing data. There is however a\nlimit to how fast you can read from this source. This limit is\nusually much higher than the consumption rate. In some cases it\nmight be slower (an NFS share, for example) in which case you might\nneed to use some buffering (see buffering).\nHTTP network element: you can PAUSE without data loss. Depending on\nthe available network bandwidth, consumption rate might be higher\nthan production rate in which case buffering should be used (see\nbuffering).\naudio source: pausing the audio capture will lead to lost data. this\nsource is therefore definitely live. In addition, an audio source\nwill produce data at a fixed rate (the samplerate). Also depending\non the buffersize, this source will introduce a latency (see\nlatency).\nudp network source: Pausing the receiving part will lead to lost\ndata. This source is therefore a live source. Also in a typical case\nthe udp packets will be received at a certain rate, which might be\ndifficult to guess because of network jitter. This source does not\nnecessarily introduce latency on its own.\ndvb source: PAUSING this element will lead to data loss, it’s a live\nsource similar to a UDP source.\n\ntemporarily stopping reading from the source causes data to be lost.\n\n\n\nfile readers: you can PAUSE without losing data.
