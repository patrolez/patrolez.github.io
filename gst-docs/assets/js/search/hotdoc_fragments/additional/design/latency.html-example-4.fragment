fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/latency.html#example-4","fragment":"Example 4\nAn example of the combination of a non-live and a live source. The non-live\nsource is connected to a live sink and the live source to a non-live sink.\nThe state changes happen in the same way as example 3. Sink will be\nable to preroll (commit its state to PAUSED). files will not be able to\npreroll.\nsink will have no latency since it is not connected to a live source. files\ndoes not do synchronisation so it does not care about latency.\nThe total latency in the pipeline is 0. The vsrc captures in sync with the\nplayback in sink.\nAs in example 3, sink can only be set to PLAYING after it successfully\nprerolled.\n"});
