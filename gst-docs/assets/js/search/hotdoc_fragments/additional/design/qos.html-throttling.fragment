fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/qos.html#throttling","fragment":"Throttling\nIn throttle mode, the time distance between buffers is kept to a\nconfigurable throttle interval. This means that effectively the buffer\nrate is limited to 1 buffer per throttle interval. This can be used to\nlimit the framerate, for example.\nWhen an element is configured in throttling mode (this is usually only\nimplemented on sinks) it should produce QoS events upstream with the\njitter field set to the throttle interval. This should instruct upstream\nelements to skip or drop the remaining buffers in the configured\nthrottle interval.\nThe proportion field is set to the desired slowdown needed to get the\ndesired throttle interval. Implementations can use the QoS Throttle\ntype, the proportion and the jitter member to tune their\nimplementations.\n"});
