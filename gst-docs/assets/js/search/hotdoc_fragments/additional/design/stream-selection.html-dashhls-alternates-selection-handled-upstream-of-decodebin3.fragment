fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stream-selection.html#dashhls-alternates-selection-handled-upstream-of-decodebin3","fragment":"DASH/HLS alternates (selection handled upstream of decodebin3)\nThere is a main (multi-bitrate or not) stream with audio and video interleaved\nin MPEG-TS. The manifest also indicates the presence of alternate language\naudio-only streams.\nA new element, hlsdemux2, used within urisourcebin, exposes one collection\ncontaining all individual elementary streams (regardless of bitrates). This is\nbased on the contents of the manifest:\nSimilar to other demuxers, it will post the collection on the bus, and will\nadd/remove pads dynamically based on GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS (or make a\ndefault choice if no event was received).\nSince it can offer a selection of \"elementary\" streams, it will internally\ndemux, parse and buffer the requested streams.\nIf ever it receives the GST_QUERY_SELECTABLE, it will set the selectable\nfield of that query to TRUE. This informs decodebin3 that it should handle all\nincoming streams and not do any selection (it is done upstream).\nThe user might want to use the korean audio track instead of the default english\none.\nWhen decodebin3 received GST_EVENT_STREAM_START on the initial incoming\nstreams, it sent a GST_QUERY_SELECTABLE which hlsdemux2 answered\nsuccesfully. decodebin3 therefore knows that the upstream of that stream can\nhandle stream-selection itself.\ndecodebin3 receives the new SELECT_STREAMS event, and knows that upstream\ncan handle stream selection and therefore forwards it upstream.\nhlsdemux2 receives the event, and prepares the audio-kor backing stream\nto be downloaded and returns. decodebin3 also returns the event as is and\ndoesn't do any selection itself.\nOnce hlsdemux2 has downloaded enough from the target audio-kor stream,\nwhich it has demuxed, parsed and buffered internally, it will output it to the\nsame output pad (replacing audio-eng):\n\n(main) variant stream : video, audio-eng\n\nalternate rendition streams : audio-kor, audio-fre\n\n\n\n[ video , audio-eng, audio-kor, audio-fre ]\n\n\nSend a new GST_EVENT_STREAM_START containing the information about\naudio-kor\n\nSend the various required events (caps, stream-collection,...)\nSend the buffers for the new stream\n\n"});
