fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stereo-multiview-video.html#encoded-signalling","fragment":"Encoded Signalling\nThis is regarding the signalling in caps and buffers from demuxers to\nparsers (sometimes) or out from encoders.\nFor backward compatibility with existing codecs many transports of\nstereoscopic 3D content use normal 2D video with 2 views packed spatially\nin some way, and put extra new descriptions in the container/mux.\nInfo in the demuxer seems to apply to stereo encodings only. For all\nMVC methods I know, the multiview encoding is in the video bitstream itself\nand therefore already available to decoders. Only stereo systems have been retro-fitted\ninto the demuxer.\nAlso, sometimes extension descriptions are in the codec (e.g. H.264 SEI FPA packets)\nand it would be useful to be able to put the info onto caps and buffers from the\nparser without decoding.\nTo handle both cases, we need to be able to output the required details on\nencoded video for decoders to apply onto the raw video buffers they decode.\nIf there ever is a need to transport multiview info for encoded data the\nsame system below for raw video or some variation should work\n"});
