It can reopen a server\nconnection requesting a new byte or time position and a new playback\nspeed. The capabilities can be queried from the server when the\nconnection is opened.\nWe assume the source element is derived from the GstPushSrc base class.\nThe base source should be configured with:\nThe do_seek() method will be called on the GstPushSrc subclass with the\nseek information passed in the GstSegment argument.\nThe rate value in the segment should be used to reopen the connection to\nthe server requesting data at the new speed and possibly a new playback\nposition.\nWhen the server connection was successfully reopened, set the rate of\nthe segment to 1.0 so that the client side trickmode is not enabled. The\napplied rate in the segment is set to the rate transformation done by\nthe server.\nAlternatively a combination of client side and serverside trickmode can\nbe used, for example if the server does not support certain rates, the\nclient can perform rate conversion for the remainder.\nAfter performing the seek, the source will inform the downstream\nelements of the new segment that is to be played back. Since the segment\nwill have a rate of 1.0, no client side trick modes are enabled. The\nsegment will have an applied rate different from 1.0 to indicate that\nthe media contains data with non-standard playback speed or direction.\n"});
