fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/stream-selection.html#changing-the-active-selection-from-the-application","fragment":"Changing the active selection from the application\nThe user wants to change the audio track. The application received the\nGST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION containing the list of available streams. For\nclarity, we will assume those stream-ids are \"video-main\", \"audio-english\"\nand \"audio-french\".\nThe user prefers to use the french soundtrack (which it knows based on the\nlanguage tag contained in the GstStream objects).\nThe application will create and send a GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAM event\ncontaining the list of streams: \"video-main\", \"audio-french\".\nThat event gets sent on the pipeline, the sinks send it upstream and eventually\nreach decodebin3.\ndecodebin3 compares:\ndecodebin3 determines that no change is required for \"video-main\", but sees\nthat it needs to deactivate \"audio-english\" and activate \"audio-french\".\nIt unlinks the multiqueue source pad connected to the current audio\ndecoder. Then it queries that audio decoder, using the GST_QUERY_ACCEPT_CAPS,\nwhether it can accept as-is the caps from the \"audio-french\" stream.\nIf it does, the multiqueue source pad corresponding to \"audio-french\" is\nlinked to the decoder.\nIf it does not, the existing audio decoder is removed, a new decoder is\nselected (like during initial auto-plugging), and replaces the old audio\ndecoder element.\nThe newly selected stream gets decoded and output through the same pad as the\nprevious audio stream.\nNote: The default behavior is to only expose one stream of each type. But\nnothing prevents decodebin3 from outputting more/less of each type if the\nGST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAM event specifies that. This allows covering more\nuse-case than the simple playback one. Such examples could be :\n\nThe currently active selection (\"video-main\", \"audio-english\")\nThe available stream collection (\"video-main\", \"audio-english\", \"audio-french\")\nThe list of streams in the event (\"video-main\", \"audio-french\")\n\n\nWanting just a video stream or just an audio stream\nWanting all decoded streams\nWanting all audio streams\n...\n\n"});
