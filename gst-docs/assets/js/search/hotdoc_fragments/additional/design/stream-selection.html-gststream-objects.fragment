Stream\nproviders should instead have separate structures to track their internal\nproperties of streams, and use a separate GstStream for storing information\nthey want to share.\nElements that create GstStream should also set it on the\nGST_EVENT_STREAM_START event of the relevant pad. This helps downstream\nelements have all information in one location.\n\nstream_id (from the STREAM_START event)\nflags (from the STREAM_START event)\ncaps\ntags\ntype (high-level type of stream: Audio, Video, Container,...)\n\n"});
