fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"additional/design/qos.html#gstbasetransform","fragment":"GstBaseTransform\nTransform elements can entirely skip the transform based on the\ntimestamp and jitter values of recent QoS event since these buffers will\ncertainly arrive too late.\nWith any intermediate element, the element should measure its\nperformance to decide if it is responsible for the quality problems or\nany upstream/downstream element.\nsome transforms can reduce the complexity of their algorithms. Depending\non the algorithm, the changes in quality may have disturbing visual or\naudible effect that should be avoided.\nA QoS message should be posted when a frame is dropped or when the\nquality of the filter is reduced. The quality member in the QOS message\nshould reflect the quality setting of the filter.\n"});
