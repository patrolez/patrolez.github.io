The only guaranteed unique name\nfor an element is its complete path in the object hierarchy. In other\nwords, an element’s name is unique inside its parent (This follows from\nGstObject’s name explanation). This uniqueness is guaranteed through\nall functions where either the parentage or name of an element is changed.\n"});
