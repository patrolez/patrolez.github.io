These things below are not\nreflecting the current implementation.\nAll formats have table of [cue-id, cue-start, (cue-end), (extra tags)]\nMany formats have metadata that references the cue-table. - loops in\ninstruments in wav, aifc - edit lists in wav, mp4\nFor mp4.edtl, wav.plst we could expose two editions. 1) the edit list is\nflattened: default, for playback 2) the stream has the raw data and the\nedit list is there as chapter markers: useful for editing software\nWe might want to introduce a new GST_TOC_ENTRY_TYPE_MARKER or _CUE.\nThis would be a sequence entry-type and it would not be used for\nnavigational purposes, but to attach data to a point in time (envelopes,\nloops, â€¦).\nAPI wise there is some overlap between: - exposing multiple audio/video\ntracks as pads or as ToC editions. For ToC editions, we have the\nTocSelect event. - exposing subtitles as a sparse stream or as ToC\nsequence of markers with labels\n\n\ncue-id is commonly represented as and unsigned int 32bit - cue-end is\noptional. Extra tags could be represented as a structure/taglist\n\n"});
