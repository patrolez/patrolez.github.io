The bus is an object that the pipeline\nprovides and that can be retrieved with gst_pipeline_get_bus().\nThe bus can be polled or added to the glib mainloop.\nThe bus is distributed to all elements added to the pipeline. The\nelements use the bus to post messages on. Various message types exist\nsuch as ERRORS, WARNINGS, EOS, STATE_CHANGED, etc..\nThe pipeline handles EOS messages received from elements in a special\nway. It will only forward the message to the application when all sink\nelements have posted an EOS message.\nOther methods for obtaining the pipeline status include the Query\nfunctionality that can be performed with gst_element_query() on the\npipeline. This type of query is useful for obtaining information about\nthe current position and total time of the pipeline. It can also be used\nto query for the supported seeking formats and ranges.\n"});
