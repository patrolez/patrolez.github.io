For frame-sequence outputs, things might look weird, but\njust adding multiview-mode to the sink caps can disallow those transports.\n\nrow-interleaved packing is actually just side-by-side memory layout with\nhalf frame width, twice the height, so can be handled by adjusting the\noverall caps and strides\nOther exotic layouts need new pixel formats defined (checker-board,\ncolumn-interleaved, side-by-side-quincunx)\n\nFrame-by-frame - one view per buffer, but with alternating metas marking\nwhich buffer is which left/right/other view and using a new buffer flag as\ndescribed above to mark the start of a group of corresponding frames.\nNew video caps addition as for encoded buffers\n\n"});
