These are meant for large copies only. A\nreasonable cutoff for using orc_memcpy() instead of memcpy() is if the\nnumber of bytes is generally greater than 100. DO NOT use orc_memcpy()\nif the typical is size is less than 20 bytes, especially if the size is\nknown at compile time, as these cases are inlined by the compiler.\n(Example: sys/ximage/ximagesink.c)\nAdd $(ORC_CFLAGS) to libgstximagesink_la_CFLAGS and $(ORC_LIBS) to\nlibgstximagesink_la_LIBADD. Then, in the source file, add:\n#ifdef HAVE_ORC #include <orc/orc.h> #else #define\norc_memcpy(a,b,c) memcpy(a,b,c) #endif\nThen switch relevant uses of memcpy() to orc_memcpy().\nThe above example works whether or not Orc is enabled at compile time.\n"});
