The structures are in the preferred\norder of the creator of the caps, with the preferred structure being\nfirst and during negotiation of caps this order should be considered to\nselect the most optimal structure.\nEach of these structures has a name that specifies the media type, e.g.\n\"video/x-theora\" to specify Theora video. Additional fields in the\nstructure add additional constraints and/or information about the media\ntype, like the width and height of a video frame, or the codec profile\nthat is used. These fields can be non-fixed (e.g. ranges) for non-fixed\ncaps but must be fixated to a fixed value during negotiation. If a field\nis included in the caps returned by a pad via the CAPS query, it imposes\nan additional constraint during negotiation. The caps in the end must\nhave this field with a value that is a subset of the non-fixed value.\nAdditional fields that are added in the negotiated caps give additional\ninformation about the media but are treated as optional. Information\nthat can change for every buffer and is not relevant during negotiation\nmust not be stored inside the caps.\nFor each of the structures in caps it is possible to store caps\nfeatures. The caps features are expressing additional requirements for a\nspecific structure, and only structures with the same name and equal\ncaps features are considered compatible. Caps features can be used to\nrequire a specific memory representation or a specific meta to be set on\nbuffers, for example a pad could require for a specific structure that\nit is passed EGLImage memory or buffers with the video meta. If no caps\nfeatures are provided for a structure, it is assumed that system memory\nis required unless later negotiation steps (e.g. the ALLOCATION query)\ndetect that something else can be used. The special ANY caps features\ncan be used to specify that any caps feature would be accepted, for\nexample if the buffer memory is not touched at all.\n"});
