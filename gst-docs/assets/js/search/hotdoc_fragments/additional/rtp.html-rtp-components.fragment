This is the bin that does it all: it adapts dynamically to your\nneeds based on the requested pads; it also contains an rtpjitterbuffer.\n\nrtpjitterbuffer\nis an RTP buffer that controls network jitter and reorders packets. It also\ndumps packets that arrive too late, handles packet retransmission and lost\npacket notification and adjusts for sender-receiver clock drift.\n\nrtpptdemux\nis an element that usually sits on the rtpbin src\npad and will detect any new payload types that arrive in the RTP stream.\nIt will then create a pad for that new payload and you can connect a\ndepayloader/decoder pipeline to that pad.\n\nrtpssrcdemux\nis an element that usually sits on the rtpbin src\npad and will detect any new SSRCs that arrive in the RTP stream.\nIt will then create a pad for that new SSRC and you can connect a\ndepayloader/decoder pipeline to that pad.\n\nGstRTPBaseDepayload\nis a base class for RTP depayloaders\n\nGstRTPBasePayload\nis a base class for RTP payloaders\nGstRTPBaseAudioPayload\nis a base class for audio RTP payloaders\n\n"});
