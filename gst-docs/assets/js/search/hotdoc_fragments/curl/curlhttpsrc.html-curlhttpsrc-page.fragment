Your libcurl library MUST be compiled against nghttp2\nfor HTTP/2 support for this functionality. HTTPS support is dependent on\ncURL being built with SSL support (OpenSSL/PolarSSL/NSS/GnuTLS).\nAn HTTP proxy must be specified by URL.\nIf the \"http_proxy\" environment variable is set, its value is used.\nThe proxy property can be used to override the default.\n"});
