It reads video width,\nheight and framerate from caps. Then it just pushes\nvideo frames without doing any decoding. It can Also\nhandle raw frames decoding them as they come, faking\nthat it is decoding them.\nWhen faking decoding encoded data, it draws a snake moving from\nleft to right in the middle of the frame. This is a\nlight weight drawing while it still provides an idea\nabout how smooth is the rendering.\nThe fake video decoder inherits from GstVideoDecoder.\nIt is useful to measure how smooth will be the whole\nrendering pipeline if you had the most efficient video\ndecoder. Also useful to bisect issues for example when\nsuspecting issues in a specific video decoder.\nIt is also useful to to use it to test the GstVideoDecoder base\nclass.\n"});
