The pixels from source have each component interleaved\nand will be packed into the planes in data.\nThis function operates on pack_lines lines, meaning that src should\ncontain at least pack_lines lines with a stride of sstride and y\nshould be a multiple of pack_lines.\nSubsampled formats will use the horizontally and vertically cosited\ncomponent from the source. Subsampling should be performed before\npacking.\nBecause this function does not have a x coordinate, it is not possible to\npack pixels starting from an unaligned position. For tiled images this\nmeans that packing should start from a tile coordinate. For subsampled\nformats this means that a complete pixel needs to be packed.\nParameters:\na GstVideoFormatInfo\nflags to control the packing\na source array\nthe source array stride\npointers to the destination data planes\nstrides of the destination planes\nthe chroma siting of the target when subsampled (not used)\nthe y position in the image to pack to\nthe amount of pixels to pack.\nPacks width pixels from src to the given planes and strides in the\nformat info.
