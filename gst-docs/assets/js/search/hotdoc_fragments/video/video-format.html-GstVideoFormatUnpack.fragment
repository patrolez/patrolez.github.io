The pixels will be unpacked into dest with each component\ninterleaved as per info's unpack_format, which will usually be one of\nGST_VIDEO_FORMAT_ARGB, GST_VIDEO_FORMAT_AYUV, GST_VIDEO_FORMAT_ARGB64 or\nGST_VIDEO_FORMAT_AYUV64 depending on the format to unpack.\ndest should at least be big enough to hold width * bytes_per_pixel bytes\nwhere bytes_per_pixel relates to the unpack format and will usually be\neither 4 or 8 depending on the unpack format. bytes_per_pixel will be\nthe same as the pixel stride for plane 0 for the above formats.\nFor subsampled formats, the components will be duplicated in the destination\narray. Reconstruction of the missing components can be performed in a\nseparate step after unpacking.\nParameters:\na GstVideoFormatInfo\nflags to control the unpacking\na destination array\npointers to the data planes\nstrides of the planes\nthe x position in the image to start from\nthe y position in the image to start from\nthe amount of pixels to unpack.\nUnpacks width pixels from the given planes and strides containing data of\nformat info.
