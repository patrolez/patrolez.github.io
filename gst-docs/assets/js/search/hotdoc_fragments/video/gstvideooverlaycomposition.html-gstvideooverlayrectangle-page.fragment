The actual\nblending of the overlay can then be done by e.g. the video sink that\nprocesses these non-raw buffers.\nit can also be used to blend overlay rectangles on top of raw video\nbuffers, thus consolidating blending functionality for raw video in\none place.\nTogether, this allows existing overlay elements to easily handle raw\nand non-raw video as input in without major changes (once the overlays\nhave been put into a GstVideoOverlayComposition object anyway) - for raw\nvideo the overlay can just use the blending function to blend the data\non top of the video, and for surface buffers it can just attach them to\nthe buffer and let the sink render the overlays.\n\n\nit can be used to attach overlay information (subtitles or logos)\nto non-raw video buffers such as GL/VAAPI/VDPAU surfaces.
