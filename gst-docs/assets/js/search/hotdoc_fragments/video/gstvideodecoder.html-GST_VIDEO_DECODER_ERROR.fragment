Such errors are counted and if there\nare too many, as configured in the context's max_errors, the pipeline will\npost an error message and the application will be requested to stop further\nmedia processing.  Otherwise, it is considered a \"glitch\" and only a warning\nis logged. In either case, ret is set to the proper value to\nreturn to upstream/caller (indicating either GST_FLOW_ERROR or GST_FLOW_OK).\nParameters:\nthe base video decoder element that generates the error\nelement defined weight of the error, added to error count\nlike CORE, LIBRARY, RESOURCE or STREAM (see Core Library-GstGError)\nerror code defined for that domain (see Core Library-GstGError)\nthe message to display (format string and args enclosed in\nparentheses)\ndebugging information for the message (format string and args\nenclosed in parentheses)\nvariable to receive return value\n"});
