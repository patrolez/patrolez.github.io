This is the amount of bytes to the\npixel immediately to the right, so basically bytes from one pixel to the\nnext. When bits < 8, the stride is expressed in bits.\nExamples: for 24-bit RGB, the pixel stride would be 3 bytes, while it\nwould be 4 bytes for RGBx or ARGB, and 8 bytes for ARGB64 or AYUV64.\nFor planar formats such as I420 the pixel stride is usually 1. For\nYUY2 it would be 2 bytes.\nParameters:\na GstVideoFormatInfo\nthe component index\n"});
