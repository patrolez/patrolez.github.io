The pads need to be named \"sink\" and \"src\". It should\nalso be able to provide fixed src pad caps in getcaps by the time it calls\ngst_video_encoder_finish_frame.\nThings that subclass need to take care of:\nThe qos property will enable the Quality-of-Service\nfeatures of the encoder which gather statistics about the real-time\nperformance of the downstream elements. If enabled, subclasses can\nuse gst_video_encoder_get_max_encode_time to check if input frames\nare already late and drop them right away to give a chance to the\npipeline to catch up.\n\nGstVideoEncoder class calls stop to inform the subclass that data\nparsing will be stopped.\n\n\nProvide pad templates\nProvide source pad caps before pushing the first buffer\nAccept data in handle_frame and provide encoded results to\ngst_video_encoder_finish_frame.\n\n"});
