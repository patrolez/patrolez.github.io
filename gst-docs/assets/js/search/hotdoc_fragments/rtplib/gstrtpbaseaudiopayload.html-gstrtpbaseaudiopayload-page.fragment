It can be used for payloading\naudio codecs. It will only work with constant bitrate codecs. It supports\nboth frame based and sample based codecs. It takes care of packing up the\naudio data into RTP packets and filling up the headers accordingly. The\npayloading is done based on the maximum MTU (mtu) and the maximum time per\npacket (max-ptime). The general idea is to divide large data buffers into\nsmaller RTP packets. The RTP packet size is the minimum of either the MTU,\nmax-ptime (if set) or available data. The RTP packet size is always larger or\nequal to min-ptime (if set). If min-ptime is not set, any residual data is\nsent in a last RTP packet. In the case of frame based codecs, the resulting\nRTP packets always contain full frames.\n"});
