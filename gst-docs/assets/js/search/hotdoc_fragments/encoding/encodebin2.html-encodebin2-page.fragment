fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"encoding/encodebin2.html#encodebin2-page","fragment":"encodebin2\nEncodebin2 is an updated version of encodebin which has a request srcpad\ninstead of having an always source pad. This makes the element more flexible\nand allows supporting muxing sinks for example.\nBased on the profile that was set (via the profile\nproperty), EncodeBin will internally select and configure the required\nelements (encoders, muxers, but also audio and video converters) so that you\ncan provide it raw or pre-encoded streams of data in input and have your\nencoded/muxed/converted stream in output.\n"});
