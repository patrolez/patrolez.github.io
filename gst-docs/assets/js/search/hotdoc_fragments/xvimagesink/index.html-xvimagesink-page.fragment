Rendering to a remote display is theoretically\npossible but i doubt that the XVideo extension is actually available when\nconnecting to a remote display. This element can receive a Window ID from the\napplication through the GstVideoOverlay interface and will then render\nvideo frames in this drawable. If no Window ID was provided by the\napplication, the element will create its own internal window and render\ninto it.\n"});
