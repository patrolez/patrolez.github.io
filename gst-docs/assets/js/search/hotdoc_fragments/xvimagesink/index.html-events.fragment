There\nare several kind of events that can be grouped in 2 big categories: input\nevents and window state related events. Input events will be translated to\nnavigation events and pushed upstream for other elements to react on them.\nThis includes events such as pointer moves, key press/release, clicks etc...\nOther events are used to handle the drawable appearance even when the data\nis not flowing (GST_STATE_PAUSED). That means that even when the element is\npaused, it will receive expose events from the drawable and draw the latest\nframe with correct borders/aspect-ratio.\n"});
