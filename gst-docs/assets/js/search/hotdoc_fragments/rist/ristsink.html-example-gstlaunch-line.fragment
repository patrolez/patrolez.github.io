The address of\neach link is configured through the \"bonding-addresses\"\nproperty. When set, this will replace the value that might have\nbeen set on the \"address\" and \"port\" properties. Each link will be\nmapped to its own RTP session. RTX request are only replied to on the\nlink the NACK was received from.\nThere are currently two bonding methods in place: \"broadcast\" and \"round-robin\".\nIn \"broadcast\" mode, all the packets are duplicated over all sessions.\nWhile in \"round-robin\" mode, packets are evenly distributed over the links. One\ncan also implement its own dispatcher element and configure it using the\n\"dispatcher\" property. As a reference, \"broadcast\" mode is implemented with\nthe \"tee\" element, while \"round-robin\" mode is implemented with the\n\"round-robin\" element.\n"});
