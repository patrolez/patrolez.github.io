It\ncurrently supports any registered RTP static payload types such as\nMPEG TS. The stream passed to this element must be already RTP\npayloaded.  Even though RTP SSRC collision are rare in\nunidirectional streaming, this element expects the upstream elements\nto obey to collision events and change the SSRC in use. Collisions\nwill occur when transmitting and receiving over multicast on the\nsame host, and will be properly ignored.\nIt also implements part of the RIST TR-06-2 Main Profile transmitter. The\ntunneling, multiplexing and encryption parts of the specification are not\nincluded. This element will include the RIST header extension if either of\nthe \"sequence-number-extension\" or \"drop-null-ts-packets\" properties are set.\n"});
