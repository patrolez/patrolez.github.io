Note that this may contain\nmultiple structures (though not likely recommended), but each of these must\nbe fixed (or will otherwise be rejected).\nIf join is TRUE, then the incoming caps' mime-type is\ncompared to the mime-type(s) of provided caps and only matching structure(s)\nare considered for updating.\nIf replace is TRUE, then any caps update is preceded by\nclearing existing fields, making provided fields (as a whole) replace\nincoming ones. Otherwise, no clearing is performed, in which case provided\nfields are added/merged onto incoming caps\nAlthough this element might mainly serve as debug helper,\nit can also practically be used to correct a faulty pixel-aspect-ratio,\nor to modify a yuv fourcc value to effectively swap chroma components or such\nalike.\n"});
