It implements an URI\nprotocol handler for the 'pushfile' protocol and behaves like a file source\nelement that cannot be activated in pull-mode. This makes it very easy to\ndebug demuxers or decoders that can operate both pull and push-based in\nconnection with the playbin element (which creates a source based on the\nURI passed).\n"});
