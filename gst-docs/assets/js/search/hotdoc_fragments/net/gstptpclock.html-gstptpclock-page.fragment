fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"net/gstptpclock.html#gstptpclock-page","fragment":"GstPtpClock\nGstPtpClock implements a PTP (IEEE1588:2008) ordinary clock in slave-only\nmode, that allows a GStreamer pipeline to synchronize to a PTP network\nclock in some specific domain.\nThe PTP subsystem can be initialized with gst_ptp_init, which then starts\na helper process to do the actual communication via the PTP ports. This is\nrequired as PTP listens on ports < 1024 and thus requires special\nprivileges. Once this helper process is started, the main process will\nsynchronize to all PTP domains that are detected on the selected\ninterfaces.\ngst_ptp_clock_new then allows to create a GstClock that provides the PTP\ntime from a master clock inside a specific PTP domain. This clock will only\nreturn valid timestamps once the timestamps in the PTP domain are known. To\ncheck this, you can use gst_clock_wait_for_sync, the GstClock::synced\nsignal and gst_clock_is_synced.\nTo gather statistics about the PTP clock synchronization,\ngst_ptp_statistics_callback_add can be used. This gives the application\nthe possibility to collect all kinds of statistics from the clock\nsynchronization.\n"});
