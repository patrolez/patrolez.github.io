fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"switchbin/index.html#switchbin-page","fragment":"switchbin\nswitchbin is a helper element which chooses between a set of\nprocessing chains (paths) based on input caps, and changes if new caps\narrive. Paths are child objects, which are accessed by the\nGstChildProxy interface.\nWhenever new input caps are encountered at the switchbin's sinkpad,\nthe * first path with matching caps is picked. The paths are looked at\nin order: path #0's caps are looked at first, checked against the new\ninput caps with gst_caps_can_intersect, and if its return value\nis TRUE, path #0 is picked. Otherwise, path #1's caps are looked at etc.\nIf no path matches, an error is reported.\nIn this example, if the data is raw PCM audio with 44.1 kHz, a volume\nelement is used for reducing the audio volume to 10%. Otherwise, it is\njust passed through. So, a 44.1 kHz MP3 will sound quiet, a 48 kHz MP3\nwill be at full volume.\nThis example's path #1 is a fallback \"catch-all\" path. Its caps are \"ANY\" caps,\nso any input caps will match against this. A catch-all path with an identity element\nis useful for cases where certain kinds of processing should only be done for specific\nformats, like the example above (it applies volume only to 44.1 kHz PCM audio).\n\n"});
