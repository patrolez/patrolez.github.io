See decklinkvideosink.\nFor Capturing the options are as follows:\nWhen capturing from a duplex-unit, the secondary port outputs the captured image\nunchanged.\nWhen simultaneously capturing and playing out onto the same device, the\nsecondary port outputs the played out video. Note, that this can also be\nachieved using half-duplex mode.\nCapturing Video on the primary port of device 0, output flipped version of the\nvideo on secondary port of the same device.\n"});
