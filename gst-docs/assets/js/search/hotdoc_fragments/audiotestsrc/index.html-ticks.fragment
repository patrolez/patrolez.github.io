Instead, it produces finite-length sine wave pulses (the \"ticks\").\nIt is useful for detecting time shifts between audio signal, for example\nbetween RTSP audio clients that shall play synchronized. It is also useful\nfor generating a signal that feeds the trigger of an oscilloscope.\nTo further help with oscilloscope triggering and time offset detection,\nthe waveform can apply a different volume to every Nth tick (this is then\ncalled the \"marker tick\"). For instance, one could generate a tick every\n100ms, and make every 20th tick a marker tick (meaning that every 2 seconds\nthere is a marker tick). This is useful for detecting large time offsets\nwhile still frequently triggering an oscilloscope.\nAlso, a \"ramp\" can be applied to the begin & end of ticks. The sudden\nstart of the sine tick is a discontinuity, even if the sine wave starts\nat 0. The* resulting artifacts can often make it more difficult to use the\nticks for an oscilloscope's trigger. To that end, an initial \"ramp\" can\nbe applied. The first few samples are modulated by a cubic function to\nreduce the impact of the discontinuity, resulting in smaller artifacts.\nThe number of samples equals floor(samplerate / sine-wave-frequency).\nExample: with a sample rate of 48 kHz and a sine wave frequency of 10 kHz,\nthe first 4 samples are modulated by the cubic function.\n"});
