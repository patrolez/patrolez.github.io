The wave is shown using a\nscope visualizer from libvisual, allowing you to visually verify that\nthe saw wave is correct.\nThis pipeline produces a series of 10 kHz sine wave ticks. Each tick is\n20 sine wave periods long, ticks occur every 100 ms and have a volume of\n0.4. Every 10th tick is a marker tick and has the default marker tick volume\nof 1.0. The beginning and end of the ticks are modulated with the ramp.\n"});
