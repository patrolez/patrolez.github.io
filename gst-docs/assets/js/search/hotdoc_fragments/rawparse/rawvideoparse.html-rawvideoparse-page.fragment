In the former case, it will continue to\nreceive buffers until there is enough input data to output one frame. In the\nlatter case, it will extract the first frame in the buffer and output it, then\nthe second one etc. until the remaining unparsed bytes aren't enough to form\na complete frame, and it will then continue as described in the earlier case.\nIf the properties configuration is used, plane strides and offsets will be\ncomputed by using gst_video_info_set_format. This can be overridden by passing\nGstValueArrays to the plane-offsets and plane-strides properties. When this is\ndone, these custom offsets and strides are used later even if new width,\nheight, format etc. property values might be set. To switch back to computed\nplane strides & offsets, pass NULL to one or both of the plane-offset and\nplane-array properties.\nThe frame size property is useful in cases where there is extra data between\nthe frames (for example, trailing metadata, or headers). The parser calculates\nthe actual frame size out of the other properties and compares it with this\nframe-size value. If the frame size is larger than the calculated size,\nthen the extra bytes after the end of the frame are skipped. For example, with\n8-bit grayscale frames and a actual frame size of 100x10 pixels and a frame-size of\n1500 bytes, there are 500 excess bytes at the end of the actual frame which\nare then skipped. It is safe to set the frame size to a value that is smaller\nthan the actual frame size (in fact, its default value is 0); if it is smaller,\nthen no trailing data will be skipped.\nIf a framerate of 0 Hz is set (for example, 0/1), then output buffers will have\nno duration set. The first output buffer will have a PTS 0, all subsequent ones\nan unset PTS.\n"});
