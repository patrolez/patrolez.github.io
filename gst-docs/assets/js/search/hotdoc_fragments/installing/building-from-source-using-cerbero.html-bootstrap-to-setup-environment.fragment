This command installs the missing parts of the build system using the\npackages manager when available, and also downloads the necessary toolchains\nwhen building for Windows/MinGW or Android.\nNote that this will take a while (a couple hours or even more on Windows).\nOn Linux and macOS, this will use sudo to make changes to the system.\nThe bootstrap process will then install or build all packages required to build\nGStreamer.\n"});
