It generates build\ninstructions which can then be executed by ninja. The GStreamer\nproject uses it for all subprojects.\nIn September 2021 all of the main GStreamer modules were merged into a\nsingle code repository, the GStreamer mono repo which lives\nin the main GStreamer git repository, and this is where all\nGStreamer development happens nowadays for GStreamer version 1.19/1.20 and later.\nBefore the mono repository merge the different GStreamer modules lived in\nseparate git repositories and there was a separate meta-builder project\ncalled gst-build to download and build all the subprojects.\nThis is what you should use if you want to build or develop against older\nstable branches such as GStreamer 1.16 or 1.18.\nIf you want to build or develop against upcoming development or stable branches\nyou should use the main branch of the GStreamer module containing the mono\nrepository.\nIn the following sections we will only talk about the GStreamer mono repo,\nbut gst-build works pretty much the same way, the only difference being\nthat it would download the various GStreamer submodules as well.\n"});
