Then go to the Property Manager\n(View→Property Manager), right-click on your project and select “Add\nExisting Property Sheet...”.\nIn Visual Studio 2017, the property manager can be found in\nView→Other Windows→Property Manager\nNavigate to %GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86%\\share\\vs\\2010\\libs and load gstreamer-1.0.props.\nThis property sheet contains the directories where the headers and\nlibraries are located, and the necessary options for the compiler and\nlinker, so you do not need to change anything else in your project.\nIf you cannot find the Property Manager, you might need to enable Expert\nSettings. Go to Tools → Settings → Expert Settings. Upon first\ninstallation of Visual Studio, Expert Settings are disabled by\ndefault.\n\n\nDepending on the GStreamer libraries you need to use, you will have to add more property pages,\nbesides gstreamer-1.0  (each property page corresponds to one GStreamer library).\nThe tutorial's project files already contain all necessary property pages. When developing your own applications,\nthe GStreamer documentation will tell you what library a function belongs to, and therefore, what property pages you need to add.\n"});
