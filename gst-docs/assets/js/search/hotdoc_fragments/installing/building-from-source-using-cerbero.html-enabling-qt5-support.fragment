You can toggle that on by\nenabling the qt5 variant.\nYou must also tell Cerbero where your Qt5 installation prefix is. You can do it\nby setting the QMAKE environment variable to point to the qmake that you\nwant to use, f.ex. /path/to/Qt5.12.0/5.12.0/ios/bin/qmake\nWhen building for Android Universal with Qt < 5.14, instead of QMAKE, you\nmust set the QT5_PREFIX environment variable pointed to the directory\ninside your prefix which contains all the android targets, f.ex.\n/path/to/Qt5.12.0/5.12.0.\nNext, run package:\nThis will try to build the Qt5 QML plugin and error out if Qt5 could not be\nfound or if the plugin could not be built. The plugin will be automatically\nadded to the package outputted.\nNOTE: The package outputted will not contain a copy of the Qt5 libraries in\nit. You must link to them while building your app yourself.\n"});
