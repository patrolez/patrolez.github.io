fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"installing/building-from-source-using-cerbero.html#download-the-sources","fragment":"Download the sources\nTo build GStreamer using Cerbero, you first need to download Cerbero:\nThis will build the latest unreleased GStreamer code.\nDespite the presence of setup.py this tool does not need installation. It is\ninvoked via the cerbero-uninstalled script, which should be invoked as\n./cerbero-uninstalled, or you can create an alias to it in your .bashrc\nfile.\nYou can build a specific release by checking out that tag, for example git checkout 1.18.4. Building a release tag will cause Cerbero to use the release\ntarballs instead of git repositories when fetching gstreamer recipes for\nbuilding.\nYou can also build the latest unreleased 'stable branch' code, for instance for\n1.18 you'd do: git checkout 1.18, or git clone -b 1.18 [...], which will\nfetch the corresponding stable branches when building gstreamer recipes.\nYou can also use git worktrees, which may be more convenient when building\nseveral different versions of gstreamer since the build artefacts always go\ninto the build directory inside the git repository.\n"});
