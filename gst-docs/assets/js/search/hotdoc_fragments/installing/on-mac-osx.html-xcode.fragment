There is a small\nexception to the regular use of frameworks, and you will need to manually\ninclude the headers (/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Headers) and\nlibraries (/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Libraries) search path. In\nXCode you will need to do the following:\n\nAdd GStreamer.framework to General → Frameworks and Libraries\n\nAdd the libraries path to Build Settings → Library Search Paths\n\nAdd the headers path to Build Settings → System Header Search Paths\n\nDisable hardened runtime Build Settings → Enable Hardened Runtime. This\nis needed because the GStreamer.framework is not signed.\n\n"});
