In order to make it\neasier for development and testing, there is a target (provided by gst-build\nor the mono repository, and in future directly by meson itself) which will\nsetup environment variables accordingly so that you can use all the\nbuild results directly.\nFor anyone familiar with python and virtualenv, you will feel right at home.\nThe script is called gst-env.py, it is located in the root of the\nGStreamer mono-repository.\nAnother way to enter the virtual environment is to execute ninja -C <path/to/build_directory> devenv. This option has less options and is\ntherefore not compatible with some workflows.\nNOTE: you cannot use meson or reconfigure with ninja within the virtual\nenvironment, therefore build before entering the environment or build from\nanother terminal/terminal-tab.\n"});
