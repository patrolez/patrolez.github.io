This is normal,\nwe are not finished yet.\nProvide native development support by activating the NDK plugin:\nRight-click on the project in the Project Explorer (this should be the\ntop-most folder,\ncalled com.gst_sdk_tutorials.tutorial_1.Tutorial1) → Android\ntools → Add Native Support… Here the NDK plugin asks for a library name.\nThis is irrelevant and any valid file name will do. Accept.\nEclipse will still complain about errors in the code. This is\nnormal. Some files are missing because they are generated during the\nfirst build run.\nBuild the project: Project → Build Project. If you bring up the Eclipse\nConsole, you should see some progress messages. Once finished, the\nmissing files will appear and all error messages should be gone. The\nproject is now ready to run. Hit Run → Run.\nA new application called “Android tutorial 1” should now be available on\nyour device, with the GStreamer logo. If you want to run the\ntutorial in an Android Virtual Device (AVD), make sure to create the\ndevice with support for audio playback and GPU Emulation (to enable\nOpenGL ES).\n"});
