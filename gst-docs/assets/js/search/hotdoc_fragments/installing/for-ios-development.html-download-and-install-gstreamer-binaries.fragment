In case the system complains about the package not\nbeing signed, you can control-click it and open to start the\ninstallation. When you do this, it will warn you, but there is an option\nto install anyway. Otherwise you can go to System Preferences → Security\nand Privacy → General and select the option to allow installation of\npackages from \"anywhere\".\nThe GStreamer SDK installs itself in your home directory, so it is\navailable only to the user that installed it. The SDK library is\ninstalled to ~/Library/Developer/GStreamer/iPhone.sdk. Inside this\ndirectory there is the GStreamer.framework that contains the libs,\nheaders and resources, and there is a Templates directory that has\nXcode application templates for GStreamer development. Those templates\nare also copied to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates during\ninstallation so that Xcode can find them.\n"});
