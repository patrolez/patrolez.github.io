You must define an environment variable called\nGSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID and point it to the folder where you\nextracted the GStreamer binaries. This environment variable must be available at\nbuild time, so maybe you want to make it available system-wide by\nadding it to your ~/.profile file (on Linux and Mac) or to the\nEnvironment Variables in the System Properties dialog (on Windows).\nPoint GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID to the folder where you unzipped the binaries.\n If you plan to use Android Studio and do not want to define this\nenvironment variable globally, you can set it inside the build.gradle.\n If you plan to use Eclipse, and do not want to define this\nenvironment variable globally, you can set it inside Eclipse. Go to\nWindow → Preferences → C/C++ → Build → Build Variables and define\nGSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID there.\n The NDK support in the Gradle build system used by\nAndroid Studio is still in beta, so the recommended way to build\nusing the GStreamer SDK is still to use \"ndk-build\".\n"});
