The suggested\ndefault is usually OK.\n\nIf you plan to use Visual Studio, close it before installing GStreamer.\nThe installer will define new environment variables which will not be picked up by Visual Studio if it is open.\nOn Windows 8 and Windows 10, it might be necessary to log out and log back in to your account\nafter the installation for the newly defined environment variables to be picked up by Visual Studio.\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that, at runtime,\nGStreamer can access its libraries and plugins. It can be done by adding\n%GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86%\\bin to the PATH environment variable, or\nby running the application from this same folder.\nHow to do this:\nWindows start icon > Search \"environment variables\" > Edit the system environment variables (will open System Properties)\nEnvironment Variables > System variables > Variable :Path > Edit > New > Paste \"C:\\gstreamer\\1.0\\msvc_x86_64\\bin\" > OK\nAt runtime, GStreamer will look for its plugins in the following folders:\nSo, typically, if your application can find gstreamer-1.0-0.dll,\nit will find the GStreamer plugins, as long as the installation folder\nstructure is unmodified. If you do change this structure in your\napplication, then you can use the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment\nvariable to point GStreamer to its plugins. The plugins are initially\nfound at %GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86%\\lib\\gstreamer-1.0.\nAdditionally, if you want to prevent GStreamer from looking in all the\ndefault folders listed above, you can set the GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH\nenvironment variable to point where the plugins are located.\n\nThe runtime files are needed to run GStreamer applications. You probably want\nto distribute these files with your application (or the installer below).\nThe development files are additional files you need at build-time to\ncreate GStreamer applications.\nThe Merge Modules\nfiles are additional files you can use to deploy GStreamer binaries\nalongside your application (see Windows deployment).\n\n\nRuntime installer: e.g. gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-{VERSION}.msi\n\nDevelopment files installer: e.g. gstreamer-1.0-devel-msvc-x86_64-{VERSION}.msi\n\n\n\n%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEFOLDER%/.gstreamer-1.0/plugins\nC:\\gstreamer\\1.0\\x86\\lib\\gstreamer-1.0\n<location of gstreamer-1.0-0.dll>\\..\\lib\\gstreamer-1.0\n%GST_PLUGIN_PATH%\n\n"});
