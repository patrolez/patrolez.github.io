If the directory is\nnot created it will be done so at this point. Note that older versions of meson\ncould run without any command argument, this is now deprecated.\nThere is only one restriction regarding the location of the build_directory:\nit can't be the same as the source directory (i.e. where you cloned your module).\nIt can be outside of that directory or below/within that directory though.\nOnce meson is done configuring, you can either:\nenter the specified build directory and run ninja.\nor instead of switching to the build directory every time you wish to\nexecute ninja commands, you can just specify the build directory as an\nargument. The advantage of this option is that you can run it from anywhere\n(instead of changing to the ninja directory)\nThis will build everything from that module (and subprojects if building\ngst-build or the mono repository).\nNote: You do not need to re-run meson when you modify source files, you just\nneed to re-run ninja. If you build/configuration files changed, ninja will\nfigure out on its own that meson needs to be re-run and will do that\nautomatically.\n"});
