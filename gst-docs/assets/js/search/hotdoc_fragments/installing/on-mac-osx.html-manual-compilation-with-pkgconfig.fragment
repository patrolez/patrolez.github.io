So we will\nnow build the same example we used above with pkg-config and asking for the\nrequired GStreamer flags.\nIt's important to use the pkg-config provided by the GStreamer.framework\n(not the one provided by Homebrew for example), that's why we set PATH to find\npkg-config from the right location.\nNote how we have used pkg-config --cflags gstreamer-1.0 to obtain all the\ncompilation flags and then pkg-config --libs gstreamer-1.0 to get all the\nlinker flags.\nThe commands above should have generated an executable that, as before, we can\ninspect:\nYou can see how the dependencies are different from the ones we saw above. The\nreason is because in this case we have linked directly to the GStreamer\nlibraries included in the framework instead of the framework itself (there's a\nslight difference there).\n"});
