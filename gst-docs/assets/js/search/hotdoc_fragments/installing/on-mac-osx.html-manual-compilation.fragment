Here's a very simple example to show you how:\nLet's say we have a file main.c that requires GStreamer and looks like this:\nWe can compile it and link it with the following commands:\nNote how we use -I/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Headers to specify\nthe headers search path (same as with XCode) and in the linking step we specify\n-L/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Libraries to indicate the libraries\nsearch path (as we also did in XCode), -F/Library/Frameworks to tell the\nlinker where to find frameworks and finally -framework GStreamer to specify\nthe GStreamer framework.\nFinally, we can even inspect the generated executable and verify it's pointing\nto our GStreamer framework:\n"});
