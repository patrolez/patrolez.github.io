You must explicitly opt-in to this by enabling\nthe visualstudio variant:\nIf you already have a Cerbero build, it is highly recommended to run the wipe\ncommand before switching to building with Visual Studio.\nSome plugins that require external dependencies will be automatically\ndisabled when\nrunning in this mode.\nCurrently, most recipes that use Meson (btype = BuildType.MESON) and those\nthat have the can_msvc recipe property set to True are built with Visual\nStudio.\n"});
