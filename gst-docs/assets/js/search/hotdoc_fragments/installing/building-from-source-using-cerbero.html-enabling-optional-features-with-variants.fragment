You\ncan see a full list of available variants by running:\nSome variants are enabled by default while others are not. You can enable\na particular variant by doing one of the following:\nMultiple variants can either be separated by a comma or with multiple -v\narguments, for example the following are equivalent:\nTo explicitly disable a variant, use novariantname instead.\nIn the case of multiple enabling/disable of the same variant, then the last\ncondition on the command line will take effect.  e.g. if novariantname is last\nthen variantname is disabled.\n\nEither invoke cerbero-uninstalled with the -v argument, for example:\n\n\nOr, edit ~/.cerbero/cerbero.cbc and add variants = ['variantname'] at the\nbottom. Create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\n"});
