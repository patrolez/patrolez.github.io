It uses\nthe XDamage extension if available to only capture areas of the screen that\nhave changed since the last frame. It uses the XFixes extension if\navailable to also capture your mouse pointer. It supports handling of\nmouse and keyboard events. By default it will fixate to 25 frames per second.\nApplications are expected to call XinitThreads() before any other threads\nare started. For use in gst-launch-1.0 or other GStreamer command line\napplications it is also possible to set the GST_XINITTHREADS=1 environment\nvariable so that XInitThreads() gets called when the plugin is loaded. This\nmay be too late in other use case scenarios though, so applications should\nnot rely on that.\n"});
