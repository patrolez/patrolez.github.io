Properties may be appended to elements in the\nform property=value.\nFor a more complete description of possible PIPELINE-DESCRIPTIONS see the\nsection Pipeline Description below or consult the GStreamer documentation.\nPlease note that gst-launch-1.0 is primarily a debugging tool. You should\nnot build applications on top of it. For applications, use the\ngst_parse_launch() function of the GStreamer API as an easy way to construct\npipelines from pipeline descriptions.\n"});
