Likewise, xvimagesink can be substituted with d3dvideosink,\nximagesink, sdlvideosink, osxvideosink, or aasink. Keep in mind though\nthat different sinks might accept different formats and even the same sink might\naccept different formats on different machines, so you might need to add\nconverter elements like audioconvert and audioresample for audio or\nvideoconvert in front of the sink to make things work.\n"});
