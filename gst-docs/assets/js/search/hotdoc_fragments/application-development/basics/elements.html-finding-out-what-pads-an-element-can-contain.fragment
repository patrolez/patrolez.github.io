This can be used to provide a codec selection list\nfor encoders, or it can be used for autoplugging purposes for media\nplayers. All current GStreamer-based media players and autopluggers work\nthis way. We'll look closer at these features as we learn about GstPad\nand GstCaps in the next chapter: Pads and capabilities\n"});
