These pads are not created\nautomatically but are only created on demand. This is very useful for\nmultiplexers, aggregators and tee elements. Aggregators are elements\nthat merge the content of several input streams together into one output\nstream. Tee elements are the reverse: they are elements that have one\ninput stream and copy this stream to each of their output pads, which\nare created on request. Whenever an application needs another copy of\nthe stream, it can simply request a new output pad from the tee element.\nThe following piece of code shows how you can request a new output pad\nfrom a “tee” element:\nThe gst_element_request_pad_simple () method can be used to get a pad\nfrom the element based on the name of the pad template. It is also\npossible to request a pad that is compatible with another pad template.\nThis is very useful if you want to link an element to a multiplexer\nelement and you need to request a pad that is compatible. The method\ngst_element_get_compatible_pad () can be used to request a compatible\npad, as shown in the next example. It will request a compatible pad from\nan Ogg multiplexer from any input.\n"});
