fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/basics/init.html#simple-initialization","fragment":"Simple initialization\nBefore the GStreamer libraries can be used, gst_init has to be called\nfrom the main application. This call will perform the necessary\ninitialization of the library as well as parse the GStreamer-specific\ncommand line options.\nA typical program [1] would have code to initialize GStreamer that\nlooks like this:\nUse the GST_VERSION_MAJOR, GST_VERSION_MINOR and GST_VERSION_MICRO\nmacros to get the GStreamer version you are building against, or use the\nfunction gst_version to get the version your application is linked\nagainst. GStreamer currently uses a scheme where versions with the same\nmajor and minor versions are API- and ABI-compatible.\nIt is also possible to call the gst_init function with two NULL\narguments, in which case no command line options will be parsed by\nGStreamer.\n"});
