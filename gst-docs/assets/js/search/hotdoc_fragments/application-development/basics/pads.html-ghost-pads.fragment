This is where \"ghost pads\" come into play.\n\nA ghost pad is a pad from some element in the bin that can be accessed\ndirectly from the bin as well. Compare it to a symbolic link in UNIX\nfilesystems. Using ghost pads on bins, the bin also has a pad and can\ntransparently be used as an element in other parts of your code.\n\nVisualisation of a GstBin element with a ghost\npad is a\nrepresentation of a ghost pad. The sink pad of element one is now also a\npad of the bin. Because ghost pads look and work like any other pads,\nthey can be added to any type of elements, not just to a GstBin, just\nlike ordinary pads.\nA ghostpad is created using the function gst_ghost_pad_new ():\nIn the above example, the bin now also has a pad: the pad called “sink”\nof the given element. The bin can, from here on, be used as a substitute\nfor the sink element. You could, for example, link another element to\nthe bin.\n"});
