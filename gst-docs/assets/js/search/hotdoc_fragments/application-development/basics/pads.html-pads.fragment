fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/basics/pads.html#pads","fragment":"Pads\nA pad type is defined by two properties: its direction and its\navailability. As we've mentioned before, GStreamer defines two pad\ndirections: source pads and sink pads. This terminology is defined from\nthe view of within the element: elements receive data on their sink pads\nand generate data on their source pads. Schematically, sink pads are\ndrawn on the left side of an element, whereas source pads are drawn on\nthe right side of an element. In such graphs, data flows from left to\nright. [1]\nPad directions are very simple compared to pad availability. A pad can\nhave any of three availabilities: always, sometimes and on request. The\nmeaning of those three types is exactly as it says: always pads always\nexist, sometimes pads exist only in certain cases (and can disappear\nrandomly), and on-request pads appear only if explicitly requested by\napplications.\n"});
