The category can be used to\nget the type of the element that can be created using this element\nfactory. Examples of categories include Codec/Decoder/Video (video\ndecoder), Codec/Encoder/Video (video encoder), Source/Video (a video\ngenerator), Sink/Video (a video output), and all these exist for audio\nas well, of course. Then, there's also Codec/Demuxer and Codec/Muxer\nand a whole lot more. gst-inspect will give a list of all factories,\nand gst-inspect <factory-name> will list all of the above information,\nand a lot more.\nYou can use gst_registry_pool_feature_list (GST_TYPE_ELEMENT_FACTORY)\nto get a list of all the element factories that GStreamer knows about.\n"});
