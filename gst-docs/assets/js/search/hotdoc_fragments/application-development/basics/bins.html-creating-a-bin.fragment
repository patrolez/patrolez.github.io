fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/basics/bins.html#creating-a-bin","fragment":"Creating a bin\nBins are created in the same way that other elements are created, i.e.\nusing an element factory. There are also convenience functions available\n(gst_bin_new () and gst_pipeline_new ()). To add elements to a bin\nor remove elements from a bin, you can use gst_bin_add () and\ngst_bin_remove (). Note that the bin that you add an element to will\ntake ownership of that element. If you destroy the bin, the element will\nbe dereferenced with it. If you remove an element from a bin, it will be\ndereferenced automatically.\nThere are various functions to lookup elements in a bin. The most\ncommonly used are gst_bin_get_by_name () and gst_bin_get_by_interface (). You can also iterate over all elements that a bin contains using\nthe function gst_bin_iterate_elements (). See the API references of\nGstBin\nfor details.\n"});
