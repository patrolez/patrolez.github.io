fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/basics/bins.html#what-are-bins","fragment":"What are bins\nBins allow you to combine a group of linked elements into one logical\nelement. You do not deal with the individual elements anymore but with\njust one element, the bin. We will see that this is extremely powerful\nwhen you are going to construct complex pipelines since it allows you to\nbreak up the pipeline in smaller chunks.\nThe bin will also manage the elements contained in it. It will perform\nstate changes on the elements as well as collect and forward bus\nmessages.\n\nThere is one specialized type of bin available to the GStreamer\nprogrammer:\n\nA pipeline: a generic container that manages the synchronization and\nbus messages of the contained elements. The toplevel bin has to be a\npipeline, every application thus needs at least one of these.\n\n"});
