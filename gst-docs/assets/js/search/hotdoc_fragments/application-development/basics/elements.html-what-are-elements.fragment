fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/basics/elements.html#what-are-elements","fragment":"What are elements?\nFor the application programmer, elements are best visualized as black\nboxes. On the one end, you might put something in, the element does\nsomething with it and something else comes out at the other side. For a\ndecoder element, for example, you'd put in encoded data, and the element\nwould output decoded data. In the next chapter (see Pads and\ncapabilities), you will learn more about data input\nand output in elements, and how you can set that up in your application.\n"});
