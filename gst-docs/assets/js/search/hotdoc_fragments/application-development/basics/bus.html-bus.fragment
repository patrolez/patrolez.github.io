fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/basics/bus.html#bus","fragment":"Bus\nA bus is a simple system that takes care of forwarding messages from the\nstreaming threads to an application in its own thread context. The\nadvantage of a bus is that an application does not need to be\nthread-aware in order to use GStreamer, even though GStreamer itself is\nheavily threaded.\nEvery pipeline contains a bus by default, so applications do not need to\ncreate a bus or anything. The only thing applications should do is set a\nmessage handler on a bus, which is similar to a signal handler to an\nobject. When the mainloop is running, the bus will periodically be\nchecked for new messages, and the callback will be called when any\nmessage is available.\n"});
