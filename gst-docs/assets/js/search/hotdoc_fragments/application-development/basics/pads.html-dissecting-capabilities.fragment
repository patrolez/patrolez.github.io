Internally, a\nGstCaps\nwill contain one or more\nGstStructure\nthat will describe one media type. A negotiated pad will have\ncapabilities set that contain exactly one structure. Also, this\nstructure will contain only fixed values. These constraints are not\ntrue for unnegotiated pads or pad templates.\nAs an example, below is a dump of the capabilities of the “vorbisdec”\nelement, which you will get by running gst-inspect vorbisdec. You will\nsee two pads: a source and a sink pad. Both of these pads are always\navailable, and both have capabilities attached to them. The sink pad\nwill accept vorbis-encoded audio data, with the media type\n“audio/x-vorbis”. The source pad will be used to send raw (decoded)\naudio samples to the next element, with a raw audio media type (in this\ncase, “audio/x-raw”). The source pad will also contain properties for\nthe audio samplerate and the amount of channels, plus some more that you\ndon't need to worry about for now.\n"});
