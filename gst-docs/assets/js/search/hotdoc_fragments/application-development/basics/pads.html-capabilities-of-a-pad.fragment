For an in-depth\nlook into capabilities and a list of all capabilities defined in\nGStreamer, see the Plugin Writers Guide\nCapabilities are attached to pad templates and to pads. For pad\ntemplates, it will describe the types of media that may stream over a\npad created from this template. For pads, it can either be a list of\npossible caps (usually a copy of the pad template's capabilities), in\nwhich case the pad is not yet negotiated, or it is the type of media\nthat currently streams over this pad, in which case the pad has been\nnegotiated already.\n"});
