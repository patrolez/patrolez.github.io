Many of the virtues of the GStreamer\nframework come from its modularity: GStreamer can seamlessly incorporate\nnew plugin modules. But because modularity and power often come at a\ncost of greater complexity, writing new applications is not always easy.\nThis guide is intended to help you understand the GStreamer framework\nso you can develop applications based on it. The first\nchapters will focus on development of a simple audio player, with much\neffort going into helping you understand GStreamer concepts. Later\nchapters will go into more advanced topics related to media playback and\nother forms of media processing (capture, editing, etc.).\n"});
