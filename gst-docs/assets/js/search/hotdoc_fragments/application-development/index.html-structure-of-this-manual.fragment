Each part addresses a particular broad topic concerning\nGStreamer application development. The parts of this guide are laid out\nin the following order:\nAbout GStreamer gives you an overview of GStreamer, its design\nprinciples and foundations.\nBuilding an Application covers the basics of GStreamer\napplication programming. At the end of this part, you should be able to\nbuild your own audio player using GStreamer\nIn Advanced GStreamer concepts, we will move on to advanced\nsubjects which make GStreamer stand out from its competitors. We will discuss\napplication-pipeline interaction using dynamic parameters and interfaces, we\nwill discuss threading and threaded pipelines, scheduling and clocks (and\nsynchronization). Most of those topics are not just there to introduce you to\ntheir API, but primarily to give a deeper insight into solving application\nprogramming problems with GStreamer and understanding their concepts.\nNext, in Higher-level interfaces for GStreamer applications, we\nwill go into higher-level programming APIs for GStreamer. You don't\nneed to know all the details from the previous parts to understand this, but\nyou will need to understand basic GStreamer concepts nevertheless. We will,\namongst others, discuss playbin and autopluggers.\nFinally in Appendices, you will find some random\ninformation on integrating with GNOME, KDE, OS X or Windows, some\ndebugging help and general tips to improve and simplify GStreamer\nprogramming.\n"});
