Since bins are\nsubclasses of elements themselves, you can mostly control a bin as if it\nwere an element, thereby abstracting away a lot of complexity for your\napplication. You can, for example change state on all elements in a bin\nby changing the state of that bin itself. Bins also forward bus messages\nfrom their contained children (such as error messages, tag messages or\nEOS messages).\nA pipeline is a top-level bin. It provides a bus for the application\nand manages the synchronization for its children. As you set it to\nPAUSED or PLAYING state, data flow will start and media processing will\ntake place. Once started, pipelines will run in a separate thread until\nyou stop them or the end of the data stream is reached.\n\n"});
