The buffering element will post BUFFERING\nmessages that the application needs to handle as explained in\nBuffering. The following properties can be used\nto configure the buffering method:\nThe buffer-size property allows you to configure a maximum size in\nbytes for the buffer element.\nThe buffer-duration property allows you to configure a maximum size\nin time for the buffer element. The time will be estimated based on\nthe bitrate of the network.\nWith the download property you can enable the download buffering method\nas described in Download buffering. Setting this\noption to TRUE will only enable download buffering for selected\nformats such as quicktime, flash video, avi and webm.\nYou can also enable buffering on the parsed/demuxed data with the\nuse-buffering property. This is interesting to enable buffering on\nslower random access media such as a network file server.\nURIDecodebin can be easily tested on the commandline, e.g. by using the\ncommand gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin uri=file:///file.ogg ! ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! autoaudiosink.\n\n\nThe buffer-size property allows you to configure a maximum size in\nbytes for the buffer element.\n\n\nThe buffer-duration property allows you to configure a maximum size\nin time for the buffer element.
