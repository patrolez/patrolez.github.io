fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/highlevel/playback-components.html#playback-components","fragment":"Playback Components\nGStreamer includes several higher-level components to simplify an\napplication developer's life. All of the components discussed here (for\nnow) are targetted at media playback. The idea of each of these\ncomponents is to integrate as closely as possible with a GStreamer\npipeline, but to hide the complexity of media type detection and several\nother rather complex topics that have been discussed in Advanced\nGStreamer concepts.\nWe currently recommend people to use either playbin (see\nPlaybin) or decodebin (see Decodebin),\ndepending on their needs. Playbin is the recommended solution for\neverything related to simple playback of media that should just work.\nDecodebin is a more flexible autoplugger that could be used to add more\nadvanced features, such as playlist support, crossfading of audio tracks\nand so on. Its programming interface is more low-level than that of\nplaybin, though.\n"});
