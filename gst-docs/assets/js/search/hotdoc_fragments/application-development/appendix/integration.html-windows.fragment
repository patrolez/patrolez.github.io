GStreamer-1.0 has much better\nsupport for win32 than previous versions though and should usually\ncompile and work out-of-the-box both using MSYS/MinGW or Microsoft\ncompilers. The GStreamer web site\nand the mailing list\narchives are\na good place to check the latest win32-related news.\nGStreamer builds using Microsoft Visual C .NET 2003 and using Cygwin.\n"});
