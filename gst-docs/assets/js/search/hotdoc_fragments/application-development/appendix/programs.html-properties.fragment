Characters in\nstrings may be escaped with the backtick (\\). If the right-hand side\nis all digits, it is considered to be an integer. If it is all digits\nand a decimal point, it is a double. If it is \"true\", \"false\", \"TRUE\",\nor \"FALSE\" it is considered to be boolean. Otherwise, it is parsed as a\nstring. The type of the property is determined later on in the parsing,\nand the value is converted to the target type. This conversion is not\nguaranteed to work, it relies on the g_value_convert routines. No\nerror message will be displayed on an invalid conversion, due to\nlimitations in the value convert API.\n"});
