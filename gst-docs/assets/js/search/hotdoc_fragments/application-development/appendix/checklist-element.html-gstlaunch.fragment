fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/appendix/checklist-element.html#gstlaunch","fragment":"gst-launch\ngst-launch is a simple script-like commandline application that can be\nused to test pipelines. For example, the command gst-launch audiotestsrc ! audioconvert ! audio/x-raw,channels=2 ! alsasink will run a pipeline which generates a\nsine-wave audio stream and plays it to your ALSA audio card.\ngst-launch also allows the use of threads (will be used automatically\nas required or as queue elements are inserted in the pipeline) and bins\n(using brackets, so “(” and “)”). You can use dots to imply padnames on\nelements, or even omit the padname to automatically select a pad. Using\nall this, the pipeline gst-launch filesrc location=file.ogg ! oggdemux name=d d. ! queue ! theoradec ! videoconvert ! xvimagesink d. ! queue ! vorbisdec ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink will play an Ogg file containing a Theora video-stream and a Vorbis\naudio-stream. You can also use autopluggers such as decodebin on the\ncommandline. See the manual page of gst-launch for more information.\n"});
