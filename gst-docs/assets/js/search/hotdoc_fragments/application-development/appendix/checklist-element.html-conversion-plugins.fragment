Specifically, those are videoscalers (videoscale),\ncolorspace convertors (videoconvert), audio format convertors and\nchannel resamplers (audioconvert) and audio samplerate convertors\n(audioresample). Those convertors don't do anything when not required,\nthey will act in passthrough mode. They will activate when the hardware\ndoesn't support a specific request, though. All applications are\nrecommended to use those elements.\n"});
