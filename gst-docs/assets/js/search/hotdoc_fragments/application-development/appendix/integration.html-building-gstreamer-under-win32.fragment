You also have to\nmodify your system environment variables to use it from the\ncommand-line. You will also need a working Platform SDK for Windows that\nis available for free from Microsoft.\nThe projects/makefiles will generate automatically some source files\nneeded to compile GStreamer. That requires that you have installed on\nyour system some GNU tools and that they are available in your system\nPATH.\nThe GStreamer project depends on other libraries, namely :\nGLib\nlibxml2\nlibintl\nlibiconv\nWork is being done to provide pre-compiled GStreamer-1.0 libraries as a\npackages for win32. Check the GStreamer web\nsite and check our mailing\nlist for the\nlatest developments in this respect.\nNote\nGNU tools needed that you can find on\nhttp://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/\nGNU flex (tested with 2.5.4)\nGNU bison (tested with 1.35)\nand http://www.mingw.org/\nthe generated files from the -auto makefiles will be available soon\nseparately on the net for convenience (people who don't want to\ninstall GNU tools).\n\n\nGLib\n\n\nlibxml2\n\n\nlibintl\n\n\nlibiconv\n\n\n\n\nGNU flex (tested with 2.5.4)\n\n\nGNU bison (tested with 1.35)\n\n\n\nGNU make (tested with 3.80)\n\n"});
