The\nbuffer element will provide a push or pull based srcpad to the demuxer\nto navigate in the downloaded file.\nThis mode is only suitable when the client can determine the length of\nthe file on the server.\nIn this case, buffering messages will be emitted as usual when the\nrequested range is not within the downloaded area + buffersize. The\nbuffering message will also contain an indication that incremental\ndownload is being performed. This flag can be used to let the\napplication control the buffering in a more intelligent way, using the\nBUFFERING query, for example. See Buffering\nstrategies.\n"});
