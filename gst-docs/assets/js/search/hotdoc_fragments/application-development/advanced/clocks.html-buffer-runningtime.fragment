fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/advanced/clocks.html#buffer-runningtime","fragment":"Buffer running-time\nTo calculate a buffer running-time, we need a buffer timestamp and the\nSEGMENT event that preceded the buffer. First we can convert the\nSEGMENT event into a GstSegment object and then we can use the\ngst_segment_to_running_time () function to perform the calculation of\nthe buffer running-time.\nSynchronization is now a matter of making sure that a buffer with a\ncertain running-time is played when the clock reaches the same\nrunning-time. Usually, this task is performed by sink elements. These\nelements also have to take into account the configured pipeline's latency\nand add it to the buffer running-time before synchronizing to the pipeline\nclock.\nNon-live sources timestamp buffers with a running-time starting from 0.\nAfter a flushing seek, they will produce buffers again from a\nrunning-time of 0.\nLive sources need to timestamp buffers with a running-time matching the\npipeline running-time when the first byte of the buffer was captured.\n"});
