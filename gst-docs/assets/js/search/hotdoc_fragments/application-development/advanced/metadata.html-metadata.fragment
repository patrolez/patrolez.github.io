fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/advanced/metadata.html#metadata","fragment":"Metadata\nGStreamer makes a clear distinction between the two types of metadata it\nsupports: Stream tags, which describe the content of a stream in a non-technical\nway; and Stream-info, which is a somewhat technical description of the\nproperties of a stream. Stream tags examples include the author of a song, the\nsong's title or the album it belongs to. Examples for stream-info include video\nsize, audio samplerate, codecs used and so on.\nTags are handled using the GStreamer tagging system. Stream-info can be retrieved\nfrom a GstPad by getting the current (negotiated) GstCaps for that pad.\n"});
