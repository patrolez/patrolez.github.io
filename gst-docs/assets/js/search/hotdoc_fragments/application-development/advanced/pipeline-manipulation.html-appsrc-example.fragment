We use a colorspace conversion element to make\nsure that we feed the right format to the X server. We configure a\nvideo stream with a variable framerate (0/1) and we set the timestamps\non the outgoing buffers in such a way that we play 2 frames per second.\nNote how we use the pull mode method of pushing new buffers into appsrc\nalthough appsrc is running in push mode.\n"});
