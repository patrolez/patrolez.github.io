fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/advanced/index.html#advanced-gstreamer-concepts","fragment":"Advanced GStreamer concepts\nWith the basics you learned in the previous part you should be able to create a\nsimple application, but GStreamer provides far more than just the mere basic for\nmultimedia playback. In this part we will cover more advanced GStreamer features\nas well as some of its low-level internals.\nSome chapters of this part serve mostly as an explanation of how GStreamer\ninternally works; like the ones covering scheduling, autoplugging and synchronization.\nThis knowledge is generally not required for actual application development.\nOther chapters, however, discuss more advanced ways of pipeline-application\ninteraction that can be very useful for certain applications. These include the\nchapters on metadata, querying and events, interfaces, dynamic parameters and\npipeline data manipulation.\n"});
