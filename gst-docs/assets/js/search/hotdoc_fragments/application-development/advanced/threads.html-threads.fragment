Most\nthreading internals are hidden from the application, which should make\napplication development easier. However, in some cases, applications may\nwant to have influence on some parts of those. GStreamer allows\napplications to force the use of multiple threads over some parts of a\npipeline. See When would you want to force a\nthread?.\nGStreamer can also notify you when threads are created so that you can\nconfigure things such as the thread priority or the threadpool to use.\nSee Configuring Threads in\nGStreamer.\n"});
