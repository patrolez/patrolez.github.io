This includes getting the length of a stream (if\navailable) or getting the current position. Those stream properties can\nbe retrieved in various formats such as time, audio samples, video\nframes or bytes. The function most commonly used for this is\ngst_element_query (), although some convenience wrappers are provided\nas well (such as gst_element_query_position () and\ngst_element_query_duration ()). You can generally query the pipeline\ndirectly, and it'll figure out the internal details for you, like which\nelement to query.\nInternally, queries will be sent to the sinks, and “dispatched”\nbackwards until one element can handle it; that result will be sent back\nto the function caller. Usually, that is the demuxer, although with live\nsources (from a webcam), it is the source itself.\n"});
