The goal is to only play the part from 2 to 5 seconds and then\nquit.\nIn a first step we will set a uridecodebin element to the PAUSED state\nand make sure that we block all the source pads that are created. When\nall the source pads are blocked, we have data on all of them and we say\nthat the uridecodebin is prerolled.\nIn a prerolled pipeline we can ask for the duration of the media and we\ncan also perform seeks. We are interested in performing a seek operation\non the pipeline to select the 2-to-5-seconds section.\nAfter we configure the section we want, we can link the sink element, unblock the\nsource pads and set the pipeline to the PLAYING state. You will see that\nexactly the requested region is displayed by the sink before it goes to EOS.\nHere is the code:\nNote that we use a custom application message to signal the main thread that the\nuridecodebin is prerolled. The main thread will then issue a flushing seek to\nthe requested region. The flush will temporarily unblock the pad and reblock\nthem when new data arrives again. We detect this second block to remove the\nprobes. Then we set the pipeline to PLAYING and it should play the selected\n2-to-5-seconds section; the application waits for the EOS message and quits.\n"});
