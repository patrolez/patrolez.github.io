Most application developers will be interested\nin providing feedback to the user on media progress. Media players, for\nexample, will want to show a slider showing the progress in the song,\nand usually also a label indicating stream length. Transcoding\napplications will want to show a progress bar on how much percent of the\ntask is done. GStreamer has built-in support for doing all this using a\nconcept known as querying. Since seeking is very similar, it will be\ndiscussed here as well. Seeking is done using the concept of events.\n"});
