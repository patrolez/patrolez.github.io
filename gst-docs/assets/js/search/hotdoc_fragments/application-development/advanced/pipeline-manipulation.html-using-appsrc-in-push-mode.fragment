fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/advanced/pipeline-manipulation.html#using-appsrc-in-push-mode","fragment":"Using appsrc in push mode\nWhen appsrc is configured in push mode (stream-type is stream or\nseekable), the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer method with\na new buffer. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc can be controlled\nwith the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively\nstopping/starting the push-buffer calls. The value of the min-percent\nproperty defines how empty the internal appsrc queue needs to be before\nthe need-data signal is issued. You can set this to some positive value\nto avoid completely draining the queue.\nDon't forget to implement a seek-data callback when the stream-type is\nset to GST_APP_STREAM_TYPE_SEEKABLE.\nUse this mode when implementing various network protocols or hardware\ndevices.\n"});
