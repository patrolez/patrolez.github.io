This can simply be done by changing the caps property on a\ncapsfilter. The capsfilter will send a RECONFIGURE event upstream that\nwill make the upstream element attempt to renegotiate a new format and\nallocator. This only works if the upstream element is not using fixed caps on\nits source pad.\nBelow is an example of how you can change the caps of a pipeline while\nin the PLAYING state:\nNote how we use gst_bus_poll() with a small timeout to get messages\nand also introduce a short sleep.\nIt is possible to set multiple caps for the capsfilter separated with a\n;. The capsfilter will try to renegotiate to the first possible format\nfrom the list.\n"});
