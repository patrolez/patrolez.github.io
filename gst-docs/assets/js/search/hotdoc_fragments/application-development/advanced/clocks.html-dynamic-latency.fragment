An element can request\na latency change in the pipeline by posting a LATENCY message on the\nbus. The application can then decide to query and redistribute a new\nlatency or not. Changing the latency in a pipeline might cause visual or\naudible glitches and should therefore only be done by the application\nwhen it is allowed.\n"});
