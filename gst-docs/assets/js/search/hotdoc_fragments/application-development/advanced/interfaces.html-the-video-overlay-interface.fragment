The application\nprovides a window handle to an element implementing this interface,\nand the element will then use this window handle to draw on\nrather than creating a new toplevel window. This is useful to embed\nvideo in video players.\nThis interface is implemented by, amongst others, the Video4linux2\nelements and by glimagesink, ximagesink, xvimagesink and sdlvideosink.\n"});
