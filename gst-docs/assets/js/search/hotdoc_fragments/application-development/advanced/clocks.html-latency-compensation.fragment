It does this by doing a LATENCY query on all the sinks in\nthe pipeline. The pipeline then selects the maximum latency in the\npipeline and configures this with a LATENCY event.\nAll sink elements will delay playback by the value in the LATENCY event.\nSince all sinks delay with the same amount of time, they will be\nrelatively in sync.\n"});
