fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/advanced/metadata.html#tag-writing","fragment":"Tag writing\nTag writing is done using the\nGstTagSetter\ninterface. All that's required is a tag-set-supporting element in your\npipeline.\nIn order to see if any of the elements in your pipeline supports tag writing,\nyou can use the function gst_bin_iterate_all_by_interface (pipeline, GST_TYPE_TAG_SETTER).\nOn the resulting element, usually an encoder or muxer, you can use\ngst_tag_setter_merge_tags () with a taglist or gst_tag_setter_add_tags ()\nwith individual tags, to set tags on it.\nA nice extra feature in GStreamer's tag support is that tags are preserved\nin pipelines. This means that if you transcode one file containing tags\ninto another tag-supporting media type, then the tags will be handled as part of\nthe data stream and will be so merged into the newly written media file.\n"});
