fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"application-development/advanced/clocks.html#latency","fragment":"Latency\nThe latency is the time it takes for a sample captured at timestamp X to\nreach the sink. This time is measured against the clock in the pipeline.\nFor pipelines where the only elements that synchronize against the clock\nare the sinks, the latency is always 0 since no other element is\ndelaying the buffer.\nFor pipelines with live sources, a latency is introduced, mostly because\nof the way a live source works. Consider an audio source, it will start\ncapturing the first sample at time 0. If the source pushes buffers with\n44100 samples at a time at 44100Hz it will have collected the buffer at\nsecond 1. Since the timestamp of the buffer is 0 and the time of the\nclock is now >= 1 second, the sink will drop this buffer because it is\ntoo late. Without any latency compensation in the sink, all buffers will\nbe dropped.\n"});
