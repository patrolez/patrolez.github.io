GrabCut is an\nimage segmentation method based on graph cuts technique. It can be seen as a\nway of fine-grain segmenting the image from some FG and BG \"seed\" areas. The\nOpenCV implementation follows the article [1].\nThe \"seed\" areas are taken in this element from either an input bounding box\ncoming from a face detection, or from alpha channel values. The input box is\ntaken from a \"face\" event such as the one generated from the 'facedetect'\nelement. The Alpha channel values should be one of the following (cv.hpp):\nenum{\nGC_BGD    = 0,  //!< background\nGC_FGD    = 1,  //!< foreground\nGC_PR_BGD = 2,  //!< most probably background\nGC_PR_FGD = 3   //!< most probably foreground\n};\nwith values over GC_PR_FGD interpreted as GC_PR_FGD. IN CASE OF no alpha mask\ninput (all 0's or all 1's), the 'GstOpenCvFaceDetect-face' downstream event\nis used to create a bbox of PR_FG elements. If both foreground alpha\nis not specified and there is no face detection, nothing is done.\n[1] C. Rother, V. Kolmogorov, and A.
