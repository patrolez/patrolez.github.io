In case of Constant Bitrate Encoding (CBR), the\nbitrate will determine the quality of the\nencoding.  Alternatively, one may choose to perform Constant\nQuantizer or Variable Bitrate Encoding (VBR), in which case the\nbitrate is the maximum bitrate.\nThe H264 profile that is eventually used depends on a few settings.\nIf dct8x8 is enabled, then High profile is\nused.  Otherwise, if cabac entropy coding is\nenabled or max-bframes are allowed, then Main\nProfile is in effect. The element will alway go with the maximal\nprofile available in the caps negotation and otherwise Baseline\nprofile applies. But in some cases (e.g. hardware platforms) a more\nrestrictedprofile/level may be necessary. The recommended way to\nset a profile is to set it in the downstream caps.\nYou can also set parameters to adjust the latency of encoding:\nquality-level is a number between 1-7, in the\ncase of the Intel VAAPI driver, where a lower value will produce a\nhigher quality output but with more latency; meanwhile a hihg\nnumber will produce a lower quality output with less latency. Also\nyou can set tune, if your backend supports it,\nfor low-power mode or high compression.\n"});
