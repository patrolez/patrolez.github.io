Since GStreamer might be shared\namong all applications that use it, though, the extra space requirements\nare somewhat blurred.\nSimply pack GStreamer  runtime  installer (the same one you\ninstalled in your development machine)\ninside your installer (or download it from your installer) and execute\nit silently using msiexec. msiexec is the tool that wraps most of\nthe Windows Installer functionality and offers a number of options to\nsuit your needs. You can review these options by\nexecuting msiexec without parameters. For example using 1.8.1:\nThis will bring up the installation dialog as if the user had\ndouble-clicked on the msi file. Usually, you will want to let the user\nchoose where they want to install GStreamer. An environment variable will\nlet your application locate it later on.\n"});
