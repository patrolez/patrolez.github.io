Unfortunately, you are on\nyour own on this road, besides using the Dependency\nWalker tool to discover inter-DLL\ndependencies.\nBear in mind that GStreamer is modular in nature. Plug-ins are loaded\ndepending on the media that is being played, so, if you do not know in\nadvance what files you are going to play, you do not know which DLLs you\nneed to deploy.\n"});
