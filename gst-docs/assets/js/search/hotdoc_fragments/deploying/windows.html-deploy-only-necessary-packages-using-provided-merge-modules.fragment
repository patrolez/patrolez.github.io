There is the core package, the playback package, the\nnetworking package, etc. Each package contains the necessary libraries\nand files to accomplish its task.\nThe Merge Modules are pieces that can be put together to build a larger\nWindows Installer. In this case, you just need to create a deployment\nproject for your application with Visual Studio and then add the Merge\nModules for the GStreamer packages your application needs.\nThis will produce a smaller installer than deploying the complete\nGStreamer, without the added burden of having to manually pick each\nlibrary. You just need to know which packages your application requires.\nIf you include a merge module in your deployment project, remember to\ninclude also its dependencies. Otherwise, the project will build\ncorrectly and install flawlessly, but, when executing your application,\nit will miss files.\n\n\n\n Package name\n Dependencies\n Licenses\n Description\n\n\n\n\n base-system-1.0\n\nJPEG, FreeType, BSD-like, LGPL, LGPL-2+, LGPL-2.1, LibPNG and MIT\n Base system dependencies\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-capture\n gstreamer-1.0-core, gstreamer-1.0-encoding\n LGPL and LGPL-2+\n GStreamer plugins for capture\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-codecs\n base-crypto, gstreamer-1.0-core\n BSD, Jasper-2.0, BSD-like, LGPL, LGPL-2, LGPL-2+, LGPL-2.1 and LGPL-2.1+\n GStreamer codecs\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-codecs-gpl\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n BSD-like, LGPL, LGPL-2+ and LGPL-2.1+\n GStreamer codecs under the GPL license and/or with patents issues\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n base-system-1.0\n LGPL and LGPL-2+\n GStreamer core\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-dvd\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n GPL-2+, LGPL and LGPL-2+\n GStreamer DVD support\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-effects\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL-2+\n GStreamer effects and instrumentation plugins\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-net\n base-crypto, gstreamer-1.0-core\n GPL-3, LGPL, LGPL-2+, LGPL-2.1+ and LGPL-3+\n GStreamer plugins for network protocols\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-playback\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL-2+\n GStreamer plugins for playback\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-system\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL, LGPL-2+ and LGPL-2.1+\n GStreamer system plugins\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-visualizers\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL-2+\n GStreamer visualization plugins\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-encoding\n gstreamer-1.0-core, gstreamer-1.0-playback\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n GStreamer plugins for encoding\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-editing\n gstreamer-1.0-core, gstreamer-1.0-devtools\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n GStreamer libraries and plugins for non linear editing\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-devtools\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n GStreamer developers tools\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-libav\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n GStreamer plugins wrapping ffmpeg\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-net-restricted\n base-crypto, gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n GStreamer plugins for network protocols with potential patent issues in some countries\n\n\n gstreamer-1.0-codecs-restricted\n gstreamer-1.0-core\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n GStreamer restricted codecs with potential patent issues in some countries\n\n\n base-crypto\n base-system-1.0\n LGPL and LGPL2+\n Cryptographic libraries\n\n\n\n"});
