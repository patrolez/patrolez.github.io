This file is a Python\nscript; set the following attributes to describe your application:\n At least one “files” category should be set.\nApart from the attributes listed above, it is also possible to override\nsome Recipe methods. For example the prepare method can be overridden\nto do anything before the software is built, or the install and\npost_install methods for overriding what should be done during or\nafter installation. Take a look at the existing recipes in\ncerbero/recipes for example.\nAlternatively, you can pass some options to cerbero-uninstalled so some\nof these attributes are already set for you. For example:\nSee ./cerbero-uninstalled add-recipe -h for help.\nAs an example, this is the recipe used to build the Pitivi video editor:\nCerbero gets the software sources to build from a GIT repository, which\nis specified via the git_root configuration variable from the Cerbero\nconfiguration file (see the \"Build from software\" section in Installing\non Linux) and can be overridden by the\nremotes attribute inside the recipes (if setting the origin remote).\nIn this case where no “commit” attribute is specified, Cerbero will use\nthe commit named “sdk-0.2+git” from the GIT repository when building\nSnappy.\nOnce the recipe is ready, instruct Cerbero to build it:\n"});
