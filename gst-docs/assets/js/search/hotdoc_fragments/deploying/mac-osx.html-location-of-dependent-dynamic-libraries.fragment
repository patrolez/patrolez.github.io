Instead the full path to\neach dylib is used (e.g. /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib). But there are\ntimes when a full path is not appropriate; for instance, may want your\nbinaries to be installable in anywhere on the disk.\nWe can get the list of paths used by an object file to locate its\ndependent dynamic libraries\nusing otool:\nAs you might have already noticed, if we move GStreamer to a different\nfolder, it will stop working because the runtime linker won't be able to\nfind gstreamer-1.0 in the previous location\n/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/0.10/x86/lib/libgstreamer-1.0.0.dylib.\nThis full path is extracted from the dynamic library  install name\n, a path that is used by the linker to determine its location. The\ninstall name of a library can be retrieved with\notool too:\nAny object file that links to the dynamic library gstreamer-1.0 will\nuse the\npath /Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/0.10/x86/lib/libgstreamer-1.0.0.dylib to\nlocate it, as we saw previously with gst-launch-1.0.\nSince working exclusively with full paths wouldn't let us install our\nbinaries anywhere in the path, the linker provides a mechanism of string\nsubstitution, adding three variables that can be used as a path prefix.\nAt runtime the linker will replace them with the generated path for the\nprefix. These variables are @executable_path,\n@loader_path and @rpath, described in depth in the DYNAMIC LIBRARY\nLOADING section\nof dyld's\nman page.\nFor our purpose we will use the @executable_path variable, which is\nreplaced with a fixed path, the path to the directory containing the\nmain executable: /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS.\nThe @loader_path variable can't be used in our scope, because it will\nbe replaced with the path to the directory containing the mach-o binary\nthat loaded the dynamic library, which can vary.\nTherefore, in order to relocate GStreamer we will need to replace all\npaths\ncontaining /Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/ with @executable_path/../Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/, which\ncan be done using\nthe install_name_tool\nutility\n"});
