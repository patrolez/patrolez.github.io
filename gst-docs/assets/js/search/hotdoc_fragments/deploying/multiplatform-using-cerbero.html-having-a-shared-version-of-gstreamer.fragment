Just\nlist all packages you need in the deps variable and put the files your\nsoftware needs inside the files variables. When building a package\nthis way you must make sure that you use the same prefix and\npackages_prefix as the ones in your Cerbero configuration file.\nFinally, build your package by using:\nWhere your-package is the name of the .package file that you created\nin the packages directory. This command will build your software and\nall its dependencies, and then make individual packages for them (both\nthe dependencies and your software). The resulting files will be in the\ncurrent working directory.\n"});
