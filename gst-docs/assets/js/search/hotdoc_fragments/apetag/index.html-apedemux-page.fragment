The mime type of the data between the tag blocks is detected\nusing typefind functions, and the appropriate output mime type set on\noutgoing buffers.\nThe element is only able to read APE tags at the end of a stream from\na seekable stream, ie. when get_range mode is supported by the upstream\nelements. If get_range operation is available, apedemux makes it available\ndownstream. This means that elements which require get_range mode, such as\nwavparse or musepackdec, can operate on files containing APE tag\ninformation.\n"});
