An alpha channel is added\nusing an effect specific SMPTE mask in the I420 input case. In the AYUV case,\nthe alpha channel is modified using the effect specific SMPTE mask.\nThe position property is a controllabe double between 0.0 and\n1.0 that specifies the position in the transition. 0.0 is the start of the\ntransition with the alpha channel to complete opaque where 1.0 has the alpha\nchannel set to completely transparent.\nThe depth property defines the precision in bits of the mask.\nA higher presision will create a mask with smoother gradients in order to\navoid banding.\n"});
