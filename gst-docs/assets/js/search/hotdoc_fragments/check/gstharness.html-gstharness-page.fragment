fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"check/gstharness.html#gstharness-page","fragment":"GstHarness\nGstHarness is meant to make writing unit test for GStreamer much easier.\nIt can be thought of as a way of treating a GstElement as a black box,\ndeterministically feeding it data, and controlling what data it outputs.\nThe basic structure of GstHarness is two \"floating\" GstPad that connect\nto the harnessed GstElement src and sink GstPad like so:\nWith this, you can now simulate any environment the GstElement might find\nitself in. By specifying the GstCaps of the harness GstPad, using\nfunctions like gst_harness_set_src_caps or gst_harness_set_sink_caps_str,\nyou can test how the GstElement interacts with different caps sets.\nYour harnessed GstElement can of course also be a bin, and using\ngst_harness_new_parse supporting standard gst-launch syntax, you can\neasily test a whole pipeline instead of just one element.\nYou can then go on to push GstBuffer and GstEvent on to the srcpad,\nusing functions like gst_harness_push and gst_harness_push_event, and\nthen pull them out to examine them with gst_harness_pull and\ngst_harness_pull_event.\n"});
