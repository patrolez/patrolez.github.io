fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"check/gsttestclock.html#gsttestclock-page","fragment":"GstTestClock\nGstTestClock is an implementation of GstClock which has different\nbehaviour compared to GstSystemClock. Time for GstSystemClock advances\naccording to the system time, while time for GstTestClock changes only\nwhen gst_test_clock_set_time or gst_test_clock_advance_time are\ncalled. GstTestClock provides unit tests with the possibility to\nprecisely advance the time in a deterministic manner, independent of the\nsystem time or any other external factors.\n"});
