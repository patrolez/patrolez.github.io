Runtime checks will be made to\ndetermine whether it exposes properties and signals before attempting\nto set, call or connect to them, and some functionalities of rtpbin\nmay not be available when that is not the case.\nThis should be considered experimental API, as the standard jitterbuffer\nAPI is susceptible to change, provided elements will have to update their\ncustom jitterbuffer's API to match the API of rtpjitterbuffer if and\nwhen it changes.\nParameters:\nthe object which received the signal\nthe session\n\n\tFlags:\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRun Last\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.18\n\t\t\n"});
