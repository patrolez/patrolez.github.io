When a FEC packet arrives, the element\nimmediately checks whether a media packet in the row / column it protects\ncan be reconstructed.\nSimilarly, when a media packet comes in, the element checks whether it has\nalready received a corresponding packet in both the column and row the packet\nbelongs to, and if so goes through the first step listed above.\nThis process is repeated recursively, allowing for recoveries over one\ndimension to unblock recoveries over the other.\nIn perfect networking conditions, this incurs next to no overhead as FEC\npackets will arrive after the media packets, causing no reconstruction to\ntake place, just a few checks upon chaining.\n"});
