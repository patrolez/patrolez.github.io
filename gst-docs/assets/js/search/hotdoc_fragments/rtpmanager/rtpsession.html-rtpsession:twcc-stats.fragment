This property returns a GstStructure\nwith name RTPTWCCStats with the following fields:\n\"bitrate-sent\"     G_TYPE_UINT    The actual sent bitrate of TWCC packets\n\"bitrate-recv\"     G_TYPE_UINT    The estimated bitrate for the receiver.\n\"packets-sent\"     G_TYPE_UINT    Number of packets sent\n\"packets-recv\"     G_TYPE_UINT    Number of packets reported recevied\n\"packet-loss-pct\"  G_TYPE_DOUBLE  Packetloss percentage, based on\npackets reported as lost from the receiver. Note: depending on the\nimplementation of the receiver and due to the nature of the TWCC\nRRs being sent with high frequency, out of order packets may not\nbe fully accounted for and this number could be higher than other\nmeasurement sources of packet loss.\n\"avg-delta-of-delta\", G_TYPE_INT64 In nanoseconds, a moving window\naverage of the difference in inter-packet spacing between\nsender and receiver. A sudden increase in this number can indicate\nnetwork congestion.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.18\n\t\t\n"});
