This only updates when \"is-sender\" is\nTRUE.\nThe following fields are only present for non-internal sources and\nrepresent the content of the last RB packet that was sent to this source.\nThese values are only updated when the source is sending.\nThe following fields are only present for non-internal sources and\nrepresents the last RB that this source sent. This is only updated\nwhen the source is receiving data and sending RB blocks.\nThe round trip of this source is calculated from the last RB\nvalues and the reception time of the last RB packet.
