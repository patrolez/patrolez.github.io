The\nretransmitted packets have the same ssrc and payload type as the original\nstream.\nAs a side-effect of the above, rtprtxqueue does not require the use of\nrtprtxreceive on the receiving end. rtpjitterbuffer alone is able to\nreconstruct the stream.\nRetransmission from rtprtxqueue happens as soon as the next regular flow\npacket is chained, while rtprtxsend retransmits as soon as the retransmission\nevent is received, using a helper thread.\nrtprtxqueue can be used with rtpbin without the need of hooking to its\nrequest-aux-sender signal, which means it can be used with\nrtpbin using gst-launch.\n\n"});
