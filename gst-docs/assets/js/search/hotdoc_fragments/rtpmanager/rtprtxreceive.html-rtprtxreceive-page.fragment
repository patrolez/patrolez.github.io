When it receives a packet with\na sequence number equal to one of the ones stored and with a different SSRC,\nit identifies the new SSRC (ssrc2) as the retransmission stream of ssrc1.\nFrom this point on, it replaces ssrc2 with ssrc1 in all packets of the\nssrc2 stream and flags them as retransmissions, so that rtpjitterbuffer\ncan reconstruct the original stream.\nThis algorithm is implemented as specified in RFC 4588.\nThis element is meant to be used with rtprtxsend on the sender side.\nSee rtprtxsend\nBelow you can see some examples that illustrate how rtprtxreceive and\nrtprtxsend fit among the other rtp elements and how they work internally.\nNormally, hoewever, you should avoid using such pipelines and use\nrtpbin instead, with its request-aux-sender and\nrequest-aux-receiver signals. See rtpbin.\n"});
