Its main purpose is to allow an application to easily receive\nand decode an RTP stream with multiple payload types.\nFor each payload type that is detected, a new pad will be created and the\nnew-payload-type signal will be emitted. When the payload for\nthe RTP stream changes, the payload-type-change signal will be\nemitted.\nThe element will try to set complete and unique application/x-rtp caps\non the output pads based on the result of the request-pt-map\nsignal.\n"});
