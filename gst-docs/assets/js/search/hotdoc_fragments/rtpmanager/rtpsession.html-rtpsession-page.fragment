This session can be used to send and receive RTP and RTCP packets.\nBased on what REQUEST pads are requested from the session manager, specific\nfunctionality can be activated.\nThe session manager currently implements RFC 3550 including:\nRTP packet validation based on consecutive sequence numbers.\nMaintenance of the SSRC participant database.\nKeeping per participant statistics based on received RTCP packets.\nScheduling of RR/SR RTCP packets.\nSupport for multiple sender SSRC.\nThe rtpsession will not demux packets based on SSRC or payload type, nor will\nit correct for packet reordering and jitter. Use rtpssrcdemux,\nrtpptdemux and GstRtpJitterBuffer in addition to rtpsession to\nperform these tasks. It is usually a good idea to use rtpbin, which\ncombines all these features in one element.\nTo use rtpsession as an RTP receiver, request a recv_rtp_sink pad, which will\nautomatically create recv_rtp_src pad. Data received on the recv_rtp_sink pad\nwill be processed in the session and after being validated forwarded on the\nrecv_rtp_src pad.\nTo also use rtpsession as an RTCP receiver, request a recv_rtcp_sink pad,\nwhich will automatically create a sync_src pad. Packets received on the RTCP\npad will be used by the session manager to update the stats and database of\nthe other participants. SR packets will be forwarded on the sync_src pad\nso that they can be used to perform inter-stream synchronisation when needed.\nIf you want the session manager to generate and send RTCP packets, request\nthe send_rtcp_src pad. Packet pushed on this pad contain SR/RR RTCP reports\nthat should be sent to all participants in the session.\nTo use rtpsession as a sender, request a send_rtp_sink pad, which will\nautomatically create a send_rtp_src pad. The session manager will\nforward the packets on the send_rtp_src pad after updating its internal state.\nThe session manager needs the clock-rate of the payload types it is handling\nand will signal the request-pt-map signal when it needs such a\nmapping. One can clear the cached values with the clear-pt-map\nsignal.\n\n\nRTP packet validation based on consecutive sequence numbers.\n\n\nMaintenance of the SSRC participant database.\n\n\nKeeping per participant statistics based on received RTCP packets.\n\n\nScheduling of RR/SR RTCP packets.\n\n\nSupport for multiple sender SSRC.\n\n\n"});
