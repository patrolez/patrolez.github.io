On the receiver\nside, rtprtxreceive will associate this new stream with the original and\nforward the retransmission packets to rtpjitterbuffer with the original\nssrc and payload type.\nSend two audio streams to port 5000.\nReceive two audio streams from port 5000.\nIn this example we are streaming two streams of the same type through the\nsame port. They, however, are using a different SSRC (ssrc is randomly\ngenerated on each payloader - rtpopuspay in this example), so they can be\nidentified and demultiplexed by rtpssrcdemux on the receiver side. This is\nan example of SSRC-multiplexing.\nIt is important here to use a different starting sequence number\n(seqnum-offset), since this is the only means of identification that\nrtprtxreceive uses the very first time to identify retransmission streams.\nIt is an error, according to RFC4588 to have two retransmission requests for\npackets belonging to two different streams but with the same sequence number.\nNote that the default seqnum-offset value (-1, which means random) would\nwork just fine, but it is overridden here for illustration purposes.\n"});
