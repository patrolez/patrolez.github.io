It will listen\nfor upstream custom retransmission events (GstRTPRetransmissionRequest) that\ncomes from downstream (#GstRtpSession). When receiving a request it will\nlook up the requested seqnum in its list of stored packets. If the packet\nis available, it will create a RTX packet according to RFC 4588 and send\nthis as an auxiliary stream. RTX is SSRC-multiplexed\n"});
