To enable possible skipping, set this property\nto FALSE.\nIf used in conjunction with album\nprocessing, the element will skip the number of remaining album\ntracks if a full set of tags is found for the first track.  If a subsequent\ntrack of the album is missing tags, processing cannot start again.  If this\nis undesired, the application has to scan all files beforehand and enable\nforcing of processing if needed.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\ttrue\n\n"});
