This is because the default reference\nlevel is 89 dB.  To obtain values as lined out in the original proposal of\nReplayGain, set this property to 83.\nAlmost all software uses 89 dB as a reference however, and this value has\nbecome the new official value, and that change has been acclaimed by the\noriginal author of the ReplayGain proposal.\nThe value was changed because the original proposal recommends a default\npre-amp value of +6 dB for playback.  This seemed a bit odd, as it means\nthat the algorithm has the general tendency to produce adjustment values\nthat are 6 dB too low.  Bumping the reference level by 6 dB compensated for\nthis.\nThe problem of the reference level being ambiguous for lack of concise\nstandardization is to be solved by adopting the GST_TAG_REFERENCE_LEVEL\ntag, which allows to store the used value alongside the gain values.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\t89\n\n"});
