If this gain is used during playback\n(by switching to \"album mode\"), all tracks of an album receive the same\namplification.  This keeps the relative volume levels between the tracks\nintact.  To enable this, set this property to the number of streams that\nwill be processed as album tracks.\nEvery time an EOS event is received, the value of this property is\ndecremented by one.  As it reaches zero, it is assumed that the last track\nof the album finished.  The tag list for the final stream will contain the\nadditional tags GST_TAG_ALBUM_GAIN and GST_TAG_ALBUM_PEAK.  All other\nstreams just get the two track tags posted because the values for the album\ntags are not known before all tracks are analyzed.  Applications need to\nensure that the album gain and peak values are also associated with the\nother tracks when storing the results.\nIf the total number of album tracks is unknown beforehand, just ensure that\nthe value is greater than 1 before each track starts.  Then before the end\nof the last track, set it to the value 1.\nTo perform album processing, the element has to preserve data between\nstreams.  This cannot survive a state change to the NULL or READY state.\nIf you change your pipeline's state to NULL or READY between tracks, lock\nthe element's state using gst_element_set_locked_state when it is in\nPAUSED or PLAYING.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\t0\n\n"});
