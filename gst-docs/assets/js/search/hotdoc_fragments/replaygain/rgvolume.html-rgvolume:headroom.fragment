This controls the amount by which the output can\nexceed digital full scale.\nOnly set this to a value greater than 0.0 if signal compression/limiting of\na suitable form is applied to the output (or output is brought into the\ncorrect range by some other transformation).\nThis element internally uses a volume element, which also supports\noperating on integer audio formats.  These formats do not allow exceeding\ndigital full scale.  If extra headroom is used, make sure that the raw\naudio data format is floating point (F32).  Otherwise,\nclipping distortion might be introduced as part of the volume adjustment\nitself.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\t0\n\n"});
