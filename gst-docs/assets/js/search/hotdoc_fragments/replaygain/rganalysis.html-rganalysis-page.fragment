The element\nis designed as a pass-through filter that never modifies any data.  As it\nreceives an EOS event, it finalizes the ongoing analysis and generates a tag\nlist containing the results.  It is sent downstream with a tag event and\nposted on the message bus with a tag message.  The EOS event is forwarded as\nnormal afterwards.  Result tag lists at least contain the tags\nGST_TAG_TRACK_GAIN, GST_TAG_TRACK_PEAK and GST_TAG_REFERENCE_LEVEL.\nBecause the generated metadata tags become available at the end of streams,\ndownstream muxer and encoder elements are normally unable to save them in\ntheir output since they generally save metadata in the file header.\nTherefore, it is often necessary that applications read the results in a bus\nevent handler for the tag message.  Obtaining the values this way is always\nneeded for album processing (see num-tracks property) since\nthe album gain and peak values need to be associated with all tracks of an\nalbum, not just the last one.\n"});
