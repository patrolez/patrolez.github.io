This location can be specified using any protocol supported by\nthe GIO library or it's VFS backends. Common protocols are 'file', 'http',\n'ftp', or 'smb'.\nIf an URI or GFile is not mounted giosrc will post a message of type\nGST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT with name \"not-mounted\" on the bus. The message\nalso contains the GFile and the corresponding URI.\nApplications can use the \"not-mounted\" message to mount the GFile\nby calling g_file_mount_enclosing_volume and then restart the\npipeline after the mounting has succeeded. Note that right after the\n\"not-mounted\" message a normal error message is posted on the bus which\nshould be ignored if \"not-mounted\" is handled by the application, for\nexample by calling gst_bus_set_flushing(bus, TRUE) after the \"not-mounted\"\nmessage was received and gst_bus_set_flushing(bus, FALSE) after the\nmounting was successful.\n"});
