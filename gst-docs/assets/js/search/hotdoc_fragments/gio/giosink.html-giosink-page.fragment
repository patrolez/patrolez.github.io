This location can be specified using any protocol supported by\nthe GIO library or it's VFS backends. Common protocols are 'file', 'ftp',\nor 'smb'.\nIf the URI or GFile already exists giosink will post a message of\ntype GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT with name \"file-exists\" on the bus. The message\nalso contains the GFile and the corresponding URI.\nApplications can use the \"file-exists\" message to notify the user about\nthe problem and to set a different target location or to remove the\nexisting file. Note that right after the \"file-exists\" message a normal\nerror message is posted on the bus which should be ignored if \"file-exists\"\nis handled by the application, for example by calling\ngst_bus_set_flushing(bus, TRUE) after the \"file-exists\" message was\nreceived and gst_bus_set_flushing(bus, FALSE) after the problem is\nresolved.\nSimilar to the \"file-exist\" message a \"not-mounted\" message is posted\non the bus if the target location is not mounted yet and needs to be\nmounted. This message can be used by application to mount the location\nand retry after the location was mounted successfully.\n"});
