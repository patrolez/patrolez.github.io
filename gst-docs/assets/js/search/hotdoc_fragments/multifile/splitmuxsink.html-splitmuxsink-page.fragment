fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"multifile/splitmuxsink.html#splitmuxsink-page","fragment":"splitmuxsink\nThis element wraps a muxer and a sink, and starts a new file when the mux\ncontents are about to cross a threshold of maximum size of maximum time,\nsplitting at video keyframe boundaries. Exactly one input video stream\ncan be muxed, with as many accompanying audio and subtitle streams as\ndesired.\nBy default, it uses mp4mux and filesink, but they can be changed via\nthe 'muxer' and 'sink' properties.\nThe minimum file size is 1 GOP, however - so limits may be overrun if the\ndistance between any 2 keyframes is larger than the limits.\nIf a video stream is available, the splitting process is driven by the video\nstream contents, and the video stream must contain closed GOPs for the output\nfile parts to be played individually correctly. In the absence of a video\nstream, the first available stream is used as reference for synchronization.\nIn the async-finalize mode, when the threshold is crossed, the old muxer\nand sink is disconnected from the pipeline and left to finish the file\nasynchronously, and a new muxer and sink is created to continue with the\nnext fragment. For that reason, instead of muxer and sink objects, the\nmuxer-factory and sink-factory properties are used to construct the new\nobjects, together with muxer-properties and sink-properties.\n"});
