fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"multifile/splitmuxsink.html#splitmuxsink::split-at-running-time","fragment":"\n\tsplit-at-running-time\n\nWhen called by the user, this action signal splits the video file (and\nbegins a new one) as soon as the given running time is reached. If this\naction signal is called multiple times, running times are queued up and\nprocessed in the order they were given.\nNote that this is prone to race conditions, where said running time is\nreached and surpassed before we had a chance to split. The file will\nstill split immediately, but in order to make sure that the split doesn't\nhappen too late, it is recommended to call this action signal from\nsomething that will prevent further buffers from flowing into\nsplitmuxsink before the split is completed, such as a pad probe before\nsplitmuxsink.\nParameters:\nthe splitmuxsink\n\n\tFlags:\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRun Last\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAction\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.16\n\t\t\n"});
