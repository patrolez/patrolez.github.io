This is useful for reading a large file that\nhad to be split into multiple parts due to filesystem file size limitations,\nfor example.\nThe files to select are chosen via the location property, which supports\n(and expects) shell-style wildcards (but only for the filename, not for\ndirectories). The results will be sorted.\n"});
