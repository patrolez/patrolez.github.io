The application communicates the beginning and end of a\nDTMF event using custom upstream gstreamer events. To report a DTMF event, an\napplication must send an event of type GST_EVENT_CUSTOM_UPSTREAM, having a\nstructure of name \"dtmf-event\" with fields set according to the following\ntable:\ntype (G_TYPE_INT, 0-1): The application uses this field to specify which of the two methods\nspecified in RFC 2833 to use. The value should be 0 for tones and 1 for\nnamed events. Tones are specified by their frequencies and events are specified\nby their number. This element can only take events as input. Do not confuse\nwith \"method\" which specified the output.\nnumber (G_TYPE_INT, 0-15): The event number.\nvolume (G_TYPE_INT, 0-36): This field describes the power level of the tone, expressed in dBm0\nafter dropping the sign. Power levels range from 0 to -63 dBm0. The range of\nvalid DTMF is from 0 to -36 dBm0. Can be omitted if start is set to FALSE.\nstart (G_TYPE_BOOLEAN, True or False): Whether the event is starting or ending.\nmethod (G_TYPE_INT, 1): The method used for sending event, this element will react if this\nfield is absent or 1.\nFor example, the following code informs the pipeline (and in turn, the\nRTPDTMFSrc element inside the pipeline) about the start of an RTP DTMF named\nevent '1' of volume -25 dBm0:\nWhen a DTMF tone actually starts or stop, a \"dtmf-event-processed\"\nelement GstMessage with the same fields as the \"dtmf-event\"\nGstEvent that was used to request the event. Also, if any event\nhas not been processed when the element goes from the PAUSED to the\nREADY state, then a \"dtmf-event-dropped\" message is posted on the\nGstBus in the order that they were received.\n\n\ntype (G_TYPE_INT, 0-1): The application uses this field to specify which of the two methods\nspecified in RFC 2833 to use.
