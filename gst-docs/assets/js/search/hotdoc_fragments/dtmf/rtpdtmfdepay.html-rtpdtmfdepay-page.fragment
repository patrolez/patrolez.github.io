It also emits a\nmessage on the GstBus.\nThe message is called \"dtmf-event\" and has the following fields:\ntype (G_TYPE_INT, 0-1): Which of the two methods\nspecified in RFC 2833 to use. The value should be 0 for tones and 1 for\nnamed events. Tones are specified by their frequencies and events are specified\nby their number. This element currently only recognizes events.\nDo not confuse with \"method\" which specified the output.\nnumber (G_TYPE_INT, 0-16): The event number.\nvolume (G_TYPE_INT, 0-36): This field describes the power level of the tone, expressed in dBm0\nafter dropping the sign. Power levels range from 0 to -63 dBm0. The range of\nvalid DTMF is from 0 to -36 dBm0.\nmethod (G_TYPE_INT, 1): This field will always been 1 (ie RTP event) from this element.\n\n\ntype (G_TYPE_INT, 0-1): Which of the two methods\nspecified in RFC 2833 to use.
