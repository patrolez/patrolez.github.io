Smooth Streaming (ismlmux).\nA few properties (#GstBaseQTMux:movie-timescale, trak-timescale)\nallow adjusting some technical parameters, which might be useful in (rare)\ncases to resolve compatibility issues in some situations.\nSome other properties influence the result more fundamentally.\nA typical mov/mp4 file's metadata (aka moov) is located at the end of the file,\nsomewhat contrary to this usually being called \"the header\". However, a\nfaststart file will (with some effort) arrange this to be located\nnear start of the file, which then allows it e.g. to be played while\ndownloading. Alternatively, rather than having one chunk of metadata at start\n(or end), there can be some metadata at start and most of the other data can\nbe spread out into fragments of fragment-duration. If such\nfragmented layout is intended for streaming purposes, then\nstreamable allows foregoing to add index metadata (at the end of\nfile).\n"});
