fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"libav/avvideocompare.html#avvideocompare-page","fragment":"avvideocompare\navvideocompare accepts two input video streams with the same width, height,\nframerate and format.  The two incoming buffers are compared to each other\nvia the chosen compare method (e.g. ssim or psnr).\nIf the stats-file property is specified, then the computed result for each\nframe comparison will be written to the file, or stdout if stats-file is '-'.\nThe first incoming buffer is passed through, unchanged, to the srcpad.\n"});
