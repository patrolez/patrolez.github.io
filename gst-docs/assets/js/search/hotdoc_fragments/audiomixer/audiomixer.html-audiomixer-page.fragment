Use a capsfilter\nafter the audiomixer element if you want to precisely control the format\nthat comes out of the audiomixer, which supports changing the format of\nits output while playing.\nIf you want to control the manner in which incoming data gets converted,\nsee the converter-config property, which will let\nyou for example change the way in which channels may get remapped.\nThe input pads are from a GstPad subclass and have additional\nproperties to mute each pad individually and set the volume:\n\n\"mute\": Whether to mute the pad or not (#gboolean)\n\"volume\": The volume of the pad, between 0.0 and 10.0 (#gdouble)\n\n"});
