This\nlibrary provides a whide variety of enhancement algorithms. This element\ntries to enable as much as possible. The currently enabled enhancements are\nHigh Pass Filter, Echo Canceller, Noise Suppression, Automatic Gain Control,\nand some extended filters.\nWhile webrtcdsp element can be used alone, there is an exception for the\necho canceller. The audio canceller need to be aware of the far end streams\nthat are played to loud speakers. For this, you must place a webrtcechoprobe\nelement at that far end. Note that the sample rate must match between\nwebrtcdsp and the webrtechoprobe. Though, the number of channels can differ.\nThe probe is found by the DSP element using it's object name. By default,\nwebrtcdsp looks for webrtcechoprobe0, which means it just work if you have\na single probe and DSP.\nThe probe can only be used within the same top level GstPipeline.\nAdditionally, to simplify the code, the probe element must be created\nbefore the DSP sink pad is activated. It does not need to be in any\nparticular state and does not even need to be added to the pipeline yet.\n"});
