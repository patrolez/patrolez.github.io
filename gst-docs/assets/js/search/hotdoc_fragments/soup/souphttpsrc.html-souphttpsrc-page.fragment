fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"soup/souphttpsrc.html#souphttpsrc-page","fragment":"souphttpsrc\nThis plugin reads data from a remote location specified by a URI.\nSupported protocols are 'http', 'https'.\nAn HTTP proxy must be specified by its URL.\nIf the \"http_proxy\" environment variable is set, its value is used.\nIf built with libsoup's GNOME integration features, the GNOME proxy\nconfiguration will be used, or failing that, proxy autodetection.\nThe proxy property can be used to override the default.\nIn case the iradio-mode property is set and the location is\nan HTTP resource, souphttpsrc will send special Icecast HTTP headers to the\nserver to request additional Icecast meta-information.\nIf the server is not an Icecast server, it will behave as if the\niradio-mode property were not set. If it is, souphttpsrc will\noutput data with a media type of application/x-icy, in which case you will\nneed to use the icydemux element as follow-up element to extract the Icecast\nmetadata and to determine the underlying media type.\n"});
