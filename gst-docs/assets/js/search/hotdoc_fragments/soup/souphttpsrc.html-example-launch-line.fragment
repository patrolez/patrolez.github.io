If the server sends redirects,\nthe request fails instead of following the redirect. The specified\nHTTP proxy server is used. The User-Agent HTTP request header\nis set to a custom string instead of \"GStreamer souphttpsrc.\"\nThe above pipeline reads a motion JPEG stream from an IP camera\nusing the HTTP protocol, encoded as mime/multipart image/jpeg\nparts, and writes a Matroska motion JPEG file. The width and\nheight properties are set in the caps to provide the Matroska\nmultiplexer with the information to set this in the header.\nTimestamps are set on the buffers as they arrive from the camera.\nThese are used by the mime/multipart demultiplexer to emit timestamps\non the JPEG-encoded video frame buffers. This allows the Matroska\nmultiplexer to timestamp the frames in the resulting file.\n"});
