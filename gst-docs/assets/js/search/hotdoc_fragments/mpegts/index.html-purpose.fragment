One can use\nan existing demuxer/parser element for this, or parse the packets\nthemselves.\nGenerate and multiplex MPEG-TS packets and sections. One can use an existing\nmuxer element for this.\nApplications, or external elements, can interact with the existing MPEG-TS\nelements via messages (to receive sections) or\nevents (to send sections).\n\n\nThe various Section Information (SI) and Program-Specific Information (SI),\nhandled with the GstMpegtsSection object and related\nfunctions.\n\n\nThe various descriptors present in SI/PSI, handled with the\nGstMpegtsDescriptor object and related functions.\n\n\n\n\nParsing MPEG-TS packets (PSI or PES) and extracting the sections.
