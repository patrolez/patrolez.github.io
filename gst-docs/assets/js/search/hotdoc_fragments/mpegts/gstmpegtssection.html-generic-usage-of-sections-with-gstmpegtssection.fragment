The gst_message_parse_mpegts_section function\nprovides access to the section.\nApplications (or other elements) can create them either by using one of the\ngst_mpegts_section_from_* functions, or by providing the raw SI data via\ngst_mpegts_section_new.\nElements outputting MPEG-TS streams can also create sections using the\nvarious convenience functions and then get the packetized data (to be\ninserted in MPEG-TS packets) using gst_mpegts_section_packetize.\nFor more details, refer to the ITU H.222.0 or ISO/IEC 13818-1 specifications\nand other specifications mentioned in the documentation.\n"});
