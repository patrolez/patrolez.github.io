It represents a single timeline of media,\ncontaining some combination of audio, video, and text tracks.\nAn application is responsible for feeding raw data into the Source Buffer\nusing gst_source_buffer_append_buffer and the Source Buffer will\nasynchronously process the data into tracks of time-coded multimedia samples.\nThe application as well as the associated playback component can then select\nto play media from any subset of tracks across all Source Buffers of a Media\nSource.\nA few control points are also provided to customize the behavior.\nappend-mode controls how timestamps of processed samples are\ninterpreted. They are either inserted in the timeline directly where the\ndecoded media states they should, or inserted directly after the previously\nencountered sample.\nappend-window-start / append-window-end\ncontrol the planned time window where media from appended data can be added\nto the current timeline. Any samples outside that range may be ignored.\ntimestamp-offset is added to the start time of any sample\nprocessed.\n\n\nappend-mode controls how timestamps of processed samples are\ninterpreted.
