It offers\nfunctionality similar to GstAppSrc for client-side web or JavaScript\napplications decoupling the source of media from its processing and playback.\nTo interact with a Media Source, connect it to a GstMseSrc that is in some\nGstPipeline using gst_media_source_attach. Then create at least one\nGstSourceBuffer using gst_media_source_add_source_buffer. Finally, feed\nsome media data to the Source Buffer(s) using\ngst_source_buffer_append_buffer and play the pipeline.\n"});
