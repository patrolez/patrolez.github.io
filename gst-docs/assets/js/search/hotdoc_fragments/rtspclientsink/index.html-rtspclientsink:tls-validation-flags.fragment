Accordingly, you may not safely decide to ignore any\nparticular type of error.\nFor example, it would be incorrect to mask G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if\nyou want to allow expired certificates, because this could potentially be\nthe only error flag set even if other problems exist with the\ncertificate.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\tvalidate-all\n\n"});
