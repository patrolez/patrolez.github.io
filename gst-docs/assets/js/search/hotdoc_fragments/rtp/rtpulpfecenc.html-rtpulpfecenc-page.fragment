This is to be\ncompatible with libwebrtc as using in Google Chrome and with Microsoft\nLync / Skype for Business.\nBe warned that after using this element, it is no longer possible to know if\nthere is a gap in the media stream based on the sequence numbers as the FEC\npackets become interleaved with the media packets.\nThis element will insert protection packets in any RTP stream, which\ncan then be used on the receiving side to recover lost packets.\nThis element rewrites packets' seqnums, which means that when combined\nwith retransmission elements such as rtprtxsend, it must be\nplaced upstream of those, otherwise retransmission requests will request\nincorrect seqnums.\nA payload type for the protection packets must be specified, different\nfrom the payload type of the protected packets, with the GstRtpUlpFecEnc:pt\nproperty.\nThe marker bit of RTP packets is used to determine sets of packets to\nprotect as a unit, in order to modulate the level of protection, this\nbehaviour can be disabled with GstRtpUlpFecEnc:multipacket, but should\nbe left enabled for video streams.\nThe level of protection can be configured with two properties,\npercentage and percentage-important,\nthe element will determine which percentage to use for a given set of\npackets based on the presence of the GST_BUFFER_FLAG_NON_DROPPABLE\nflag, upstream payloaders are expected to set this flag on \"important\"\npackets such as those making up a keyframe.\nThe percentage is expressed not in terms of bytes, but in terms of\npackets, this for implementation convenience. The drawback with this\napproach is that when using a percentage different from 100 %, and a\nlow bitrate, entire frames may be contained in a single packet, leading\nto some packets not being protected, thus lowering the overall recovery\nrate on the receiving side.\nWhen using rtpbin, this element should be inserted through the\nrequest-fec-encoder signal.\n"});
