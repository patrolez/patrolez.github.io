For each fragment\nan RTP packet is constructed with an RTP packet header followed by the\nfragment. In addition the payloader will make sure the packetized H.261\nstream appears as a continuous bit-stream after depacketization by shifting\nthe encoded bit-stream of a frame to align with the last significant bit of\nthe previous frame. This helps interoperability in the case where the\nencoder does not produce a continuous bit-stream but the decoder requires\nit.\n"});
