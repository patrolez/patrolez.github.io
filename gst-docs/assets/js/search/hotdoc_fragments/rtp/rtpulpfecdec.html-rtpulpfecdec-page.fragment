This is to be\ncompatible with libwebrtc as using in Google Chrome and with Microsoft\nLync / Skype for Business.\nThis element will work in combination with an upstream rtpstorage\nelement and attempt to recover packets declared lost through custom\n'GstRTPPacketLost' events, usually emitted by rtpjitterbuffer.\nIf no storage is provided using the storage\nproperty, it will try to get it from an element upstream.\nAdditionally, the payload types of the protection packets must be\nprovided to this element via its pt property.\nWhen using rtpbin, this element should be inserted through the\nrequest-fec-decoder signal.\n"});
