Due to the unavailability of a specification, we\nconsider the encoding-name as X-GST-LDAC.\nThe best reference is libldac\nand the A2DP LDAC implementation in Android's bluetooth stack [Flouride]\n(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/+/refs/heads/master/stack/a2dp/a2dp_vendor_ldac_encoder.cc).\n"});
