It will then pass-through both audio and video,\nstarting from that specific timecode or running time, making sure that\naudio starts as early as possible after the video (or at the same time as\nthe video). In the \"video-first\" mode, it only drops audio buffers until\nvideo has started.\nThe \"recording\" property acts essentially like a valve connected before\neverything else. If recording is FALSE, all buffers are dropped regardless\nof settings. If recording is TRUE, the other settings (mode,\ntarget-timecode, target-running-time, etc) are taken into account. Audio\nwill always start and end together with the video, as long as the stream\nitself doesn't start too late or end too early.\n"});
