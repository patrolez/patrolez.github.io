In that case, user could use vendor\nspecific plugins, Intel Media SDK and NVCODEC plugins for example.\nFor a system with multiple MediaFoundation compatible hardwares (i.e., GPU),\nthere can be multiple plugin features having the same role.\nAlso, there would be additional software video encoder element the system\nmeets requirement.\nThe naming rule for the non-primary encoder is mf{codec}device{index}enc\nwhere index is an arbitrary index number of hardware starting from 1.\nTo get a list of all available elements, user can run\n"});
