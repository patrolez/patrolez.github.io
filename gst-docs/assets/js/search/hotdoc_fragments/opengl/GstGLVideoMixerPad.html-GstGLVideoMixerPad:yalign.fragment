For example, setting the yalign property to 0.0\nwill align the top edge of the image with the top edge of the bounding box;\n0.5 aligns the vertical center of the image with the vertical center of the\nbounding box; 1.0 aligns the bottom edge of the image with the bottom edge\nof the bounding box; and so it goes.\nThis property is only effective when sizing-policy\nis set to 'keep-aspect-ratio'.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\t0.5\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.24\n\t\t\n"});
