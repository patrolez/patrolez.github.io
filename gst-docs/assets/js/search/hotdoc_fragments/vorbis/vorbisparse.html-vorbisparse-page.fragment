This is used in the\nmultifdsink case where you want to stream live vorbis streams to multiple\nclients, each client has to receive the streamheaders first before they can\nconsume the vorbis packets.\nThis element also makes sure that the buffers that it pushes out are properly\ntimestamped and that their offset and offset_end are set. The buffers that\nvorbisparse outputs have all of the metadata that oggmux expects to receive,\nwhich allows you to (for example) remux an ogg/vorbis file.\n"});
