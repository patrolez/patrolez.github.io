The number of poles and the ripple parameter control the rolloff.\nThis element has the advantage over the windowed sinc bandpass and bandreject filter that it is\nmuch faster and produces almost as good results. It's only disadvantages are the highly\nnon-linear phase and the slower rolloff compared to a windowed sinc filter with a large kernel.\nFor type 1 the ripple parameter specifies how much ripple in dB is allowed in the passband, i.e.\nsome frequencies in the passband will be amplified by that value. A higher ripple value will allow\na faster rolloff.\nFor type 2 the ripple parameter specifies the stopband attenuation. In the stopband the gain will\nbe at most this value. A lower ripple value will allow a faster rolloff.\nAs a special case, a Chebyshev type 1 filter with no ripple is a Butterworth filter.\nBe warned that a too large number of poles can produce noise. The most poles are possible with\na cutoff frequency at a quarter of the sampling rate.\n"});
