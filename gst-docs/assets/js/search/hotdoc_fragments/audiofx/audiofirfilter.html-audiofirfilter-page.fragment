Before\nusage the \"kernel\" property has to be set to the filter kernel that should be\nused and the \"latency\" property has to be set to the latency (in samples)\nthat is introduced by the filter kernel. Setting a latency of n samples\nwill lead to the first n samples being dropped from the output and\nn samples added to the end.\nThe filter kernel describes the impulse response of the filter. To\ncalculate the frequency response of the filter you have to calculate\nthe Fourier Transform of the impulse response.\nTo change the filter kernel whenever the sampling rate changes the\n\"rate-changed\" signal can be used. This should be done for most\nFIR filters as they're depending on the sampling rate.\n"});
