The length parameter controls the rolloff, the window parameter\ncontrols rolloff and stopband attenuation. The Hamming window provides a faster rolloff but a bit\nworse stopband attenuation, the other way around for the Blackman window.\nThis element has the advantage over the Chebyshev lowpass and highpass filter that it has\na much better rolloff when using a larger kernel size and almost linear phase. The only\ndisadvantage is the much slower execution time with larger kernels.\n"});
