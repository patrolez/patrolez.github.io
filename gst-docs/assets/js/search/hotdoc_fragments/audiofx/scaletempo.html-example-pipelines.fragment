fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"audiofx/scaletempo.html#example-pipelines","fragment":"Example pipelines\nOR\nWhen an application sends a seek event with rate != 1.0, Scaletempo applies\nthe rate change by scaling the tempo without scaling the pitch.\nScaletempo works by producing audio in constant sized chunks\n(#GstScaletempo:stride) but consuming chunks proportional to the playback\nrate.\nScaletempo then smooths the output by blending the end of one stride with\nthe next (#GstScaletempo:overlap).\nScaletempo smooths the overlap further by searching within the input buffer\nfor the best overlap position.  Scaletempo uses a statistical cross\ncorrelation (roughly a dot-product).  Scaletempo consumes most of its CPU\ncycles here. One can use the search propery to tune how far\nthe algorithm looks.\n"});
