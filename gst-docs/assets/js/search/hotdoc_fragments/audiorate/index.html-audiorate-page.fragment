fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"audiorate/index.html#audiorate-page","fragment":"audiorate\nThis element takes an incoming stream of timestamped raw audio frames and\nproduces a perfect stream by inserting or dropping samples as needed.\nThis operation may be of use to link to elements that require or otherwise\nimplicitly assume a perfect stream as they do not store timestamps,\nbut derive this by some means (e.g. bitrate for some AVI cases).\nThe properties in, out, add\nand drop can be read to obtain information about number of\ninput samples, output samples, dropped samples (i.e. the number of unused\ninput samples) and inserted samples (i.e. the number of samples added to\nstream).\nWhen the silent property is set to FALSE, a GObject property\nnotification will be emitted whenever one of the add or\ndrop values changes.\nThis can potentially cause performance degradation.\nNote that property notification will happen from the streaming thread, so\napplications should be prepared for this.\nIf the tolerance property is non-zero, and an incoming buffer's\ntimestamp deviates less than the property indicates from what would make a\n'perfect time', then no samples will be added or dropped.\nNote that the output is still guaranteed to be a perfect stream, which means\nthat the incoming data is then simply shifted (by less than the indicated\ntolerance) to a perfect time.\n"});
