When\nthe amount of read-ahead data drops below low-percent of the configured max,\nthe element will start emitting BUFFERING messages until high-percent of max is\nreached again.\nThe downloadbuffer provides push and pull based scheduling on its source pad\nand will efficiently seek in the upstream element when needed.\nThe temp-location property will be used to notify the application of the\nallocated filename.\nWhen the downloadbuffer has completely downloaded the media, it will\npost an application message named GstCacheDownloadComplete\nwith the following information:\n\nG_TYPE_STRING location: the location of the completely downloaded file.\n\n"});
