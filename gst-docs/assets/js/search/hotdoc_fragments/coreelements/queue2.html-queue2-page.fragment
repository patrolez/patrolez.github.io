Any attempt to push\nmore buffers into the queue will block the pushing thread until more space\nbecomes available.\nThe queue will create a new thread on the source pad to decouple the\nprocessing on sink and source pad.\nYou can query how many buffers are queued by reading the\ncurrent-level-buffers property.\nThe default queue size limits are 100 buffers, 2MB of data, or\ntwo seconds worth of data, whichever is reached first.\nIf you set temp-template to a value such as /tmp/gstreamer-XXXXXX, the element\nwill allocate a random free filename and buffer data in the file.\nBy using this, it will buffer the entire stream data on the file independently\nof the queue size limits, they will only be used for buffering statistics.\nThe temp-location property will be used to notify the application of the\nallocated filename.\nIf the use-buffering property is set to TRUE, and any writable\nproperty is modified, queue2 will attempt to post a buffering message\nif the changes to the properties also cause the buffering percentage to be\nchanged (for example, because the queue's capacity was changed and it already\ncontains some data).\n"});
