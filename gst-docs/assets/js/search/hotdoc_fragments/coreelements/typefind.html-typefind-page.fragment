fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"coreelements/typefind.html#typefind-page","fragment":"typefind\nDetermines the media-type of a stream. It applies typefind functions in the\norder of their rank. Once the type has been detected it sets its src pad caps\nto the found media type.\nWhenever a type is found the have-type signal is\nemitted, either from the streaming thread or the application thread\n(the latter may happen when typefinding is done pull-based from the\nstate change function).\nPlugins can register custom typefinders by using GstTypeFindFactory.\n"});
