Then the next stream is enabled, while\nkeeping the running time continuous for GST_FORMAT_TIME segments or\nkeeping the segment continuous for GST_FORMAT_BYTES segments.\nStreams are switched in the order in which the sinkpads were requested.\nBy default, the stream segment's base values are adjusted to ensure\nthe segment transitions between streams are continuous. In some cases,\nit may be desirable to turn off these adjustments (for example, because\nanother downstream element like a streamsynchronizer adjusts the base\nvalues on its own). The adjust-base property can be used for this purpose.\n"});
