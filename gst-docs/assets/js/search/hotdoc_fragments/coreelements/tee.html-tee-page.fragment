Branching the data flow is useful when e.g.\ncapturing a video where the video is shown on the screen and also encoded and\nwritten to a file. Another example is playing music and hooking up a\nvisualisation module.\nOne needs to use separate queue elements (or a multiqueue) in each branch to\nprovide separate threads for each branch. Otherwise a blocked dataflow in one\nbranch would stall the other branches.\n"});
