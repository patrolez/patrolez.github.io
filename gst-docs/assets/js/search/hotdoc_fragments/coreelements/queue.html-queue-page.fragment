Any attempt to push\nmore buffers into the queue will block the pushing thread until more space\nbecomes available.\nThe queue will create a new thread on the source pad to decouple the\nprocessing on sink and source pad.\nYou can query how many buffers are queued by reading the\ncurrent-level-buffers property. You can track changes\nby connecting to the notify::current-level-buffers signal (which\nlike all signals will be emitted from the streaming thread). The same\napplies to the current-level-time and\ncurrent-level-bytes properties.\nThe default queue size limits are 200 buffers, 10MB of data, or\none second worth of data, whichever is reached first.\nAs said earlier, the queue blocks by default when one of the specified\nmaximums (bytes, time, buffers) has been reached. You can set the\nleaky property to specify that instead of blocking it should\nleak (drop) new or old buffers.\nThe underrun signal is emitted when the queue has less data than\nthe specified minimum thresholds require (by default: when the queue is\nempty). The overrun signal is emitted when the queue is filled\nup. Both signals are emitted from the context of the streaming thread.\n"});
