This is a caps of mime type\n\"application/x-rtp\" that can be connected to any available RTP depayloader\nelement.\nsdpdemux will internally instantiate an RTP session manager element\nthat will handle the RTCP messages to and from the server, jitter removal,\npacket reordering along with providing a clock for the pipeline.\nsdpdemux acts like a live element and will therefore only generate data in the\nPLAYING state.\n"});
