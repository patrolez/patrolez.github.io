Use gst_tracing_get_active_tracers to\nget a list of all active tracers and find the right one by name.\nIf the GST_LEAKS_TRACER_SIG env variable is defined, you can use the\nfollowing POSIX signals to interact with the leaks tracer:\nYou can activate this tracer in the usual way by adding the string 'leaks'\nto the environment variable GST_TRACERS. Such as: GST_TRACERS=leaks\nNote that the values are separated by semicolon (;), such as:\nGST_TRACERS=leaks;latency, and multiple instances of the same tracer can be\nactive at the same time.\nParameters can also be passed to each tracer. The leaks tracer currently\naccepts five params:\nExamples:\n\nSIGUSR1: log alive objects\nSIGUSR2: create a checkpoint and print a list of objects created and\ndestroyed since the previous checkpoint.\n\n"});
