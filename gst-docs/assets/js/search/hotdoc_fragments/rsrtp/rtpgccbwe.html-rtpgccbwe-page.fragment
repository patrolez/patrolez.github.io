It implements the mathematic as closely\nto the specs as possible and sets the estimated-bitrate property\neach time a new estimate is produced. User should connect to the\nrtpgccbwe::notify::estimated-bitrate signal to make the encoders target\nthat new estimated bitrate (the overall target bitrate of the potentially\nmultiple encoders should match that target bitrate, the application is\nresponsible for determining what bitrate to give to each encode)\n"});
