The level element shows that\nthe output levels still match the one for a sine wave.\nThe vorbis encoder takes float audio data instead of the integer data\noutput by most other audio elements. This pipeline decodes a FLAC audio file\n(or any other audio file for which decoders are installed) and re-encodes\nit into an Ogg/Vorbis audio file.\nA mix matrix can be passed to audioconvert, that will govern the\nremapping of input to output channels.\nThis is required if the input channels are unpositioned and no standard layout can be determined.\nIf an empty mix matrix is specified, a (potentially truncated) identity matrix will be generated.\n"});
