It is however perfectly\npossible to encode images with other dimensions because an arbitrary\nrectangular cropping region can be set up. This element will automatically\nset up a correct cropping region if the dimensions are not multiples of 16\npixels.\nTo control the quality of the encoding, the bitrate and\nquality properties can be used. These two properties are\nmutualy exclusive. Setting the bitrate property will produce a constant\nbitrate (CBR) stream while setting the quality property will produce a\nvariable bitrate (VBR) stream.\nA videorate element is often required in front of theoraenc, especially\nwhen transcoding and when putting Theora into the Ogg container.\n"});
