This number must not be larger than max_frame_width_minus_1 + 1.\nspecifies the maximum frame height for the frames with\nspatial_id equal to i. This number must not be larger than max_frame_height_minus_1 + 1.\nspecifies the spatial_id value of the frame within the current\ntemporal unit that the frame of layer i uses for reference. If no frame within the\ncurrent temporal unit is used for reference the value must be equal to 255.\nindicates the number of pictures in a temporal picture group. If the\ntemporal_group_size is greater than 0, then the scalability structure data allows the\ninter-picture temporal dependency structure of the video sequence to be specified. If the\ntemporal_group_size is greater than 0, then for temporal_group_size pictures in the\ntemporal group, each picture's temporal layer id (@temporal_id), switch up points\n(@temporal_group_temporal_switching_up_point_flag and\ntemporal_group_spatial_switching_up_point_flag), and the reference picture indices\n(@temporal_group_ref_pic_diff) are specified. The first picture specified in a temporal\ngroup must have temporal_id equal to 0. If the parameter temporal_group_size is not\npresent or set to 0, then either there is only one temporal layer or there is no fixed\ninter-picture temporal dependency present going forward in the video sequence. Note that\nfor a given picture, all frames follow the same inter-picture temporal dependency\nstructure. However, the frame rate of each layer can be different from each other. The\nspecified dependency structure in the scalability structure data must be for the highest\nframe rate layer.\nspecifies the temporal_id value for the i-th picture in\nthe temporal group.\nis set to 1 if subsequent (in decoding\norder) pictures with a temporal_id higher than temporal_group_temporal_id[i] do not\ndepend on any picture preceding the current picture (in coding order) with temporal_id\nhigher than temporal_group_temporal_id[ i ].\nis set to 1 if spatial layers of the\ncurrent picture in the temporal group (i.e., pictures with a spatial_id higher than zero)\ndo not depend on any picture preceding the current picture in the temporal group.\nindicates the number of reference pictures used by the i-th\npicture in the temporal group.\nindicates, for the i-th picture in the temporal group,\nthe temporal distance between the i-th picture and the j-th reference picture used by\nthe i-th picture. The temporal distance is measured in frames, counting only frames of\nidentical spatial_id values.\n"});
