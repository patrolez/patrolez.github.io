Different loop\nfilter strength values from the array are used depending on the image plane being\nfiltered, and the edge direction (vertical or horizontal) being filtered.\nindicates the sharpness level. The loop_filter_level and\nloop_filter_sharpness together determine when a block edge is filtered, and by how much\nthe filtering can change the sample values. The loop filter process is described in AV1\nBitstream Spec. section 7.14.\nequal to 1 means that the filter level depends on the mode and\nreference frame used to predict a block. loop_filter_delta_enabled equal to 0 means that\nthe filter level does not depend on the mode and reference frame.\nequal to 1 means that the bitstream contains additional syntax\nelements that specify which mode and reference frame deltas are to be updated.\nloop_filter_delta_update equal to 0 means that these syntax elements are not present.\ncontains the adjustment needed for the filter level based on\nthe chosen reference frame. If this syntax element is not present in the bitstream,\nit maintains its previous value.\ncontains the adjustment needed for the filter level based on\nthe chosen mode. If this syntax element is not present in the bitstream, it maintains\nits previous value.\nspecifies whether loop filter delta values are present in the bitstream.\nspecifies the left shift which should be applied to decoded loop filter\ndelta values.\nequal to 1 specifies that separate loop filter deltas are sent for\nhorizontal luma edges, vertical luma edges, the U edges, and the V edges. delta_lf_multi\nequal to 0 specifies that the same loop filter delta is used for all edges.\n"});
