It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_y_points is\nless than or equal to 14.\nrepresents the x (luma value) coordinate for the i-th point of the\npiecewise linear scaling function for luma component. The values are signaled on the\nscale of 0..255. (In case of 10 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided\nby 4. In case of 12 bit video, these values correspond to luma values divided by 16.)\nIf i is greater than 0, it is a r equirement of bitstream conformance that\npoint_y_value[ i ] is greater than point_y_value[ i - 1 ] (this ensures the x coordinates\nare specified in increasing order).\nrepresents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the\npiecewise linear scaling function for luma component.\nspecifies that the chroma scaling is inferred from the luma scaling.\nspecifies the number of points for the piece-wise linear scaling function\nof the cb component. It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that num_cb_points is\nless than or equal to 10.\nrepresents the x coordinate for the i-th point of the piece-wise linear\nscaling function for cb component. The values are signaled on the scale of 0..255. If i\nis greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_cb_value[ i ]\nis greater than point_cb_value[ i - 1 ].\nrepresents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the\npiecewise linear scaling function for cb component.\nspecifies represents the number of points for the piece-wise linear scaling\nfunction of the cr component. It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that\nnum_cr_points is less than or equal to 10. If subsampling_x is equal to 1 and\nsubsampling_y is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is equal to 0, it is a requirement of\nbitstream conformance that num_cr_points is equal to 0. If subsampling_x is equal to 1\nand subsampling_y is equal to 1 and num_cb_points is not equal to 0, it is a requirement\nof bitstream conformance that num_cr_points is not equal to 0.\nrepresents the x coordinate for the i-th point of the piece-wise linear\nscaling function for cr component. The values are signaled on the scale of 0..255. If i\nis greater than 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that point_cr_value[ i ]\nis greater than point_cr_value[ i - 1 ].\nrepresents the scaling (output) value for the i-th point of the\npiecewise linear scaling function for cr component.\nrepresents the shift - 8 applied to the values of the chroma\ncomponent. The grain_scaling_minus_8 can take values of 0..3 and determines the range and\nquantization step of the standard deviation of film grain.\nspecifies the number of auto-regressive coefficients for luma and chroma.\nspecifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the Y plane.\nspecifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the U plane.\nspecifies auto-regressive coefficients used for the V plane.\nspecifies the range of the auto-regressive coefficients.
