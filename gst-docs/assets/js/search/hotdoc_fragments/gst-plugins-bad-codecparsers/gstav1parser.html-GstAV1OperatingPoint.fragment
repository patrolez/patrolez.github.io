Bit k is equal to 1 if temporal layer k should be decoded (for k between\n0 and 7). Bit j+8 is equal to 1 if spatial layer j should be decoded (for j between\n0 and 3).\nequal to one indicates that there is a decoder model\nassociated with this operating point. decoder_model_present_for_this_op equal to zero\nindicates that there is not a decoder model associated.\nspecifies the time interval between the arrival of the first bit\nin the smoothing buffer and the subsequent removal of the data that belongs to the\nfirst coded frame for operating point op, measured in units of 1/90000 seconds. The\nlength of decoder_buffer_delay is specified by buffer_delay_length_minus_1 + 1, in bits.\nspecifies, in combination with decoder_buffer_delay syntax element,\nthe first bit arrival time of frames to be decoded to the smoothing buffer.\nencoder_buffer_delay is measured in units of 1/90000 seconds. For a video sequence that\nincludes one or more random access points the sum of decoder_buffer_delay and\nencoder_buffer_delay shall be kept constant.\nequal to 1 indicates that the smoothing buffer operates in low-delay\nmode for operating point op. In low-delay mode late decode times and buffer underflow\nare both permitted. low_delay_mode_flag equal to 0 indicates that the smoothing buffer\noperates in strict mode, where buffer underflow is not allowed.\nequal to 1 indicates that\ninitial_display_delay_minus_1 is specified for this operating. 0 indicates that\ninitial_display_delay_minus_1 is not specified for this operating point.\nplus 1 specifies, for operating point i, the number of\ndecoded frames that should be present in the buffer pool before the first presentable\nframe is displayed. This will ensure that all presentable frames in the sequence can\nbe decoded at or before the time that they are scheduled for display.\n"});
