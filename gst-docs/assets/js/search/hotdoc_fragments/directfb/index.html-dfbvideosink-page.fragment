It is possible to interrupt playback while\nbeing in this mode by pressing the Escape key.\nThis mode handles navigation events for every input device supported by\nthe DirectFB library, it will look for available video modes in the fb.modes\nfile and try to switch the framebuffer video mode to the most suitable one.\nDepending on hardware acceleration capabilities the element will handle\nscaling or not.\nIf no acceleration is available it will do clipping or centering of the\nvideo frames respecting the original aspect ratio.\nEmbedded: this mode will render video frames in a\nsurface provided by the\napplication developer. This is a more advanced usage of the element and\nit is required to integrate video playback in existing\nDirectFB applications.\nWhen using this mode the element just renders to the\nsurface provided by the\napplication, that means it won't handle navigation events and won't resize\nthe surface to fit video\nframes geometry. Application has to implement the necessary code to grab\ninformation about the negotiated geometry and resize there\nsurface accordingly.\nFor both modes the element implements a buffer pool allocation system to\noptimize memory allocation time and handle reverse negotiation. Indeed if\nyou insert an element like videoscale in the pipeline the video sink will\nnegotiate with it to try get a scaled video for either the fullscreen layout\nor the application provided external surface.\n\n\nStandalone: this mode will take complete control of the monitor forcing\nDirectFB to fullscreen layout.\nThis is convenient to test using the  gst-launch-1.0 command line tool or\nother simple applications.
