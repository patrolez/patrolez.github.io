The elements are\nmeant to be used in decoder wrappers which allows playbin to automatically\nhandle these streams.\ncodecalphademux will produce two streams out of a stream of buffers holding\nthe GstVideoCodecAlphaMeta. The presence of the meta is indicated by the\nusage of the field codec-alpha=(boolean)true in the caps. This is only\napplicable to VP8 and VP9 for now.\nWrappers for vp8dec and vp9dec are available, allowing seamless support for\nthese streams inside playbin (which is used by WebKit GTK and WPE).\n"});
