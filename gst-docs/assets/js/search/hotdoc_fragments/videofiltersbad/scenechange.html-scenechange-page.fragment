fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"videofiltersbad/scenechange.html#scenechange-page","fragment":"scenechange\nThe scenechange element detects scene changes (also known as shot\nchanges) in a video stream, and sends a signal when this occurs.\nApplications can listen to this signal and make changes to the\npipeline such as cutting the stream.  In addition, whenever a\nscene change is detected, a custom downstream \"GstForceKeyUnit\"\nevent is sent to downstream elements.  Most video encoder elements\nwill insert synchronization points into the stream when this event\nis received.  When used with a tee element, the scenechange element\ncan be used to align the synchronization points among multiple\nvideo encoders, which is useful for segmented streaming.\nThe scenechange element does not work with compressed video.\n"});
