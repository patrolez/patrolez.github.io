The pad\ntemplates should be installed in the subclass' class_init function, like so:\nIt is also possible to add regular pads from the subclass and implement the\ndataflow methods on these pads. This way all functionality can be implemented\ndirectly in the subclass without extra elements.\nThe src will receive the capture mode from GstCameraBin2 on the\nmode property. Possible capture modes are defined in\nGstCameraBinMode.\n\n3 pads: viewfinder, image capture, video capture\n\n"});
