For\nstrings and boxed types you will receive a copy which you will need to\nrelease with either g_free or the suitable function for the boxed type.\nParameters:\na GstStructure\nthe quark of the first field to read\nvariable arguments\nFALSE if there was a problem reading any of the fields (e.g.\nbecause the field requested did not exist, or was of a type other\nthan the type specified), otherwise TRUE.\n"});
