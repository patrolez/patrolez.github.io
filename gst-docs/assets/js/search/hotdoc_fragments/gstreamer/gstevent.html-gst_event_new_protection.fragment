The functions defined here enable this information\nto be passed in events from elements that extract it\n(e.g., ISOBMFF demuxers, MPEG DASH demuxers) to protection decrypter\nelements that use it.\nEvents containing protection system specific information are created using\ngst_event_new_protection, and they can be parsed by downstream elements\nusing gst_event_parse_protection.\nIn Common Encryption, protection system specific information may be located\nwithin ISOBMFF files, both in movie (moov) boxes and movie fragment (moof)\nboxes; it may also be contained in ContentProtection elements within MPEG\nDASH MPDs. The events created by gst_event_new_protection contain data\nidentifying from which of these locations the encapsulated protection system\nspecific information originated. This origin information is required as\nsome protection systems use different encodings depending upon where the\ninformation originates.\nThe events returned by gst_event_new_protection are implemented\nin such a way as to ensure that the most recently-pushed protection info\nevent of a particular origin and system_id will\nbe stuck to the output pad of the sending element.\nParameters:\na string holding a UUID that uniquely\nidentifies a protection system.\na GstBuffer holding protection system specific\ninformation.
