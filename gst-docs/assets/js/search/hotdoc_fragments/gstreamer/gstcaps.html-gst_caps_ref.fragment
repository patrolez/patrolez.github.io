fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstcaps.html#gst_caps_ref","fragment":"\n\tgst_caps_ref\n\nAdds a reference to a GstCaps object.\nFrom this point on, until the caller calls gst_caps_unref or\ngst_caps_make_writable, it is guaranteed that the caps object will not\nchange. This means its structures won't change, etc. To use a GstCaps\nobject, you must always have a refcount on it -- either the one made\nimplicitly by e.g. gst_caps_new_simple, or via taking one explicitly with\nthis function.\nParameters:\nthe GstCaps to reference\nthe same GstCaps object.\n"});
