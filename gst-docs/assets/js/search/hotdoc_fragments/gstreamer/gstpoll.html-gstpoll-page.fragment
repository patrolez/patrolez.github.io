fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstpoll.html#gstpoll-page","fragment":"GstPoll\nA GstPoll keeps track of file descriptors much like fd_set (used with\nselect ()) or a struct pollfd array (used with poll ()). Once created with\ngst_poll_new, the set can be used to wait for file descriptors to be\nreadable and/or writable. It is possible to make this wait be controlled\nby specifying TRUE for the controllable flag when creating the set (or\nlater calling gst_poll_set_controllable).\nNew file descriptors are added to the set using gst_poll_add_fd, and\nremoved using gst_poll_remove_fd. Controlling which file descriptors\nshould be waited for to become readable and/or writable are done using\ngst_poll_fd_ctl_read, gst_poll_fd_ctl_write and gst_poll_fd_ctl_pri.\nUse gst_poll_wait to wait for the file descriptors to actually become\nreadable and/or writable, or to timeout if no file descriptor is available\nin time. The wait can be controlled by calling gst_poll_restart and\ngst_poll_set_flushing.\nOnce the file descriptor set has been waited for, one can use\ngst_poll_fd_has_closed to see if the file descriptor has been closed,\ngst_poll_fd_has_error to see if it has generated an error,\ngst_poll_fd_can_read to see if it is possible to read from the file\ndescriptor, and gst_poll_fd_can_write to see if it is possible to\nwrite to it.\n"});
