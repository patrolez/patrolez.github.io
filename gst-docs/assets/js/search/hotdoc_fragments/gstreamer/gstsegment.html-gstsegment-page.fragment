fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstsegment.html#gstsegment-page","fragment":"GstSegment\nThis helper structure holds the relevant values for tracking the region of\ninterest in a media file, called a segment.\nThe structure can be used for two purposes:\nThe segment is usually configured by the application with a seek event which\nis propagated upstream and eventually handled by an element that performs the seek.\nThe configured segment is then propagated back downstream with a newsegment event.\nThis information is then used to clip media to the segment boundaries.\nA segment structure is initialized with gst_segment_init, which takes a GstFormat\nthat will be used as the format of the segment values. The segment will be configured\nwith a start value of 0 and a stop/duration of -1, which is undefined. The default\nrate and applied_rate is 1.0.\nThe public duration field contains the duration of the segment. When using\nthe segment for seeking, the start and time members should normally be left\nto their default 0 value. The stop position is left to -1 unless explicitly\nconfigured to a different value after a seek event.\nThe current position in the segment should be set by changing the position\nmember in the structure.\nFor elements that perform seeks, the current segment should be updated with the\ngst_segment_do_seek and the values from the seek event. This method will update\nall the segment fields. The position field will contain the new playback position.\nIf the start_type was different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, playback continues from\nthe position position, possibly with updated flags or rate.\nFor elements that want to use GstSegment to track the playback region,\nupdate the segment fields with the information from the newsegment event.\nThe gst_segment_clip method can be used to check and clip\nthe media data to the segment boundaries.\nFor elements that want to synchronize to the pipeline clock, gst_segment_to_running_time\ncan be used to convert a timestamp to a value that can be used to synchronize\nto the clock. This function takes into account the base as well as\nany rate or applied_rate conversions.\nFor elements that need to perform operations on media data in stream_time,\ngst_segment_to_stream_time can be used to convert a timestamp and the segment\ninfo to stream time (which is always between 0 and the duration of the stream).\n\nperforming seeks (handling seek events)\ntracking playback regions (handling newsegment events)\n\n"});
