It is also possible to use a non-default main\ncontext set up using g_main_context_push_thread_default (before\none had to create a bus watch source and attach it to the desired main\ncontext 'manually').\nThis function is used to receive asynchronous messages in the main loop.\nThere can only be a single bus watch per bus, you must remove it before you\ncan set a new one.\nThe bus watch will only work if a GMainLoop is being run.\nThe watch can be removed using gst_bus_remove_watch or by returning FALSE\nfrom func. If the watch was added to the default main context it is also\npossible to remove the watch using g_source_remove.\nThe bus watch will take its own reference to the bus, so it is safe to unref\nbus using gst_object_unref after setting the bus watch.\nParameters:\na GstBus to create the watch for\nA function to call when a message is received.\nuser data passed to func.\nThe event source id or 0 if bus already got an event source.\n"});
