You can use this in\ncombination with GStreamer's debug logging system as well as the functions\ngst_info_vasprintf, gst_info_strdup_vprintf and gst_info_strdup_printf\nto pretty-print the following types: GstCaps, GstStructure,\nGstCapsFeatures, GstTagList, GstDateTime, GstBuffer, GstBufferList,\nGstMessage, GstEvent, GstQuery, GstContext, GstPad, GstObject.
