The bin element\ncontains a sub-graph. Now one would like to treat the bin-element like any\nother GstElement. This is where GhostPads come into play. A GhostPad acts as\na proxy for another pad. Thus the bin can have sink and source ghost-pads\nthat are associated with sink and source pads of the child elements.\nIf the target pad is known at creation time, gst_ghost_pad_new is the\nfunction to use to get a ghost-pad. Otherwise one can use gst_ghost_pad_new_no_target\nto create the ghost-pad and use gst_ghost_pad_set_target to establish the\nassociation later on.\nNote that GhostPads add overhead to the data processing of a pipeline.\n"});
