Caps structures with\nthe same name but with a non-equal set of caps features are not compatible.\nIf a pad supports multiple sets of features it has to add multiple equal\nstructures with different feature sets to the caps.\nEmpty GstCapsFeatures are equivalent with the GstCapsFeatures that only\ncontain GST_CAPS_FEATURE_MEMORY_SYSTEM_MEMORY. ANY GstCapsFeatures as\ncreated by gst_caps_features_new_any are equal to any other GstCapsFeatures\nand can be used to specify that any GstCapsFeatures would be supported, e.g.\nfor elements that don't touch buffer memory. GstCaps with ANY GstCapsFeatures\nare considered non-fixed and during negotiation some GstCapsFeatures have\nto be selected.\nExamples for caps features would be the requirement of a specific GstMemory\ntypes or the requirement of having a specific GstMeta on the buffer. Features\nare given as a string of the format memory:GstMemoryTypeName or\nmeta:GstMetaAPIName.\n"});
