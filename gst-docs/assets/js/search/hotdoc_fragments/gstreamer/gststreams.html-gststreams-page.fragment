fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gststreams.html#gststreams-page","fragment":"GstStreams\nA GstStream is a high-level object defining a stream of data which is, or\ncan be, present in a GstPipeline.\nIt is defined by a unique identifier, a \"Stream ID\". A GstStream does not\nautomatically imply the stream is present within a pipeline or element.\nAny element that can introduce new streams in a pipeline should create the\nappropriate GstStream object, and can convey that object via the\nGST_EVENT_STREAM_START event and/or the GstStreamCollection.\nElements that do not modify the nature of the stream can add extra information\non it (such as enrich the GstCaps, or GstTagList). This is typically done\nby parsing elements.\n"});
