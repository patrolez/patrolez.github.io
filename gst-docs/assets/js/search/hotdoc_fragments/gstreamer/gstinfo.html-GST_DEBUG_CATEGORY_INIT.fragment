It is not\nearth-shattering if you don't follow these conventions, but it would be nice\nfor everyone.\nIf you define a category for a plugin or a feature of it, name the category\nlike the feature. So if you wanted to write a \"filesrc\" element, you would\nname the category \"filesrc\". Use lowercase letters only.\nIf you define more than one category for the same element, append an\nunderscore and an identifier to your categories, like this: \"filesrc_cache\"\nIf you create a library or an application using debugging categories, use a\ncommon prefix followed by an underscore for all your categories. GStreamer\nuses the GST prefix so GStreamer categories look like \"GST_STATES\". Be sure\nto include uppercase letters.\nParameters:\nthe category to initialize.\nthe name of the category.\nthe colors to use for a color representation or 0 for no color.\noptional description of the category.\n"});
