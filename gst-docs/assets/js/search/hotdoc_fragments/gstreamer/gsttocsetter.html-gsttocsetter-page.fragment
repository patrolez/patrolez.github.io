fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gsttocsetter.html#gsttocsetter-page","fragment":"GstTocSetter\nElement interface that allows setting of the TOC.\nElements that support some kind of chapters or editions (or tracks like in\nthe FLAC cue sheet) will implement this interface.\nIf you just want to retrieve the TOC in your application then all you\nneed to do is watch for TOC messages on your pipeline's bus (or you can\nperform TOC query). This interface is only for setting TOC data, not for\nextracting it. To set TOC from the application, find proper tocsetter element\nand set TOC using gst_toc_setter_set_toc.\nElements implementing the GstTocSetter interface can extend existing TOC\nby getting extend UID for that (you can use gst_toc_find_entry to retrieve it)\nwith any TOC entries received from downstream.\n"});
