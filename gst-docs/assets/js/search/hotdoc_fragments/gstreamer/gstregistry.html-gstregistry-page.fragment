Each GstPlugin is matched 1-1 with a file on disk, and may or may\nnot be loaded at a given time.\nThe primary source, at all times, of plugin information is each plugin file\nitself. Thus, if an application wants information about a particular plugin,\nor wants to search for a feature that satisfies given criteria, the primary\nmeans of doing so is to load every plugin and look at the resulting\ninformation that is gathered in the default registry. Clearly, this is a time\nconsuming process, so we cache information in the registry file. The format\nand location of the cache file is internal to gstreamer.\nOn startup, plugins are searched for in the plugin search path. The following\nlocations are checked in this order:\nThe registry cache file is loaded from\n$XDG_CACHE_HOME/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/registry-$ARCH.bin\n(where $XDG_CACHE_HOME defaults to $HOME/.cache) or the file listed in the GST_REGISTRY\nenv var. One reason to change the registry location is for testing.\nFor each plugin that is found in the plugin search path, there could be 3\npossibilities for cached information:\nIn the first two cases, the plugin is loaded and the cache updated. In\naddition to these cases, the cache may have entries for plugins that are not\nrelevant to the current process. These are marked as not available to the\ncurrent process. If the cache is updated for whatever reason, it is marked\ndirty.\nA dirty cache is written out at the end of initialization. Each entry is\nchecked to make sure the information is minimally valid. If not, the entry is\nsimply dropped.\n\nlocation from --gst-plugin-path commandline option.\nthe GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.\nthe GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH environment variable.\ndefault locations (if GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH is not set).\nThose default locations are:\n$XDG_DATA_HOME/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/plugins/\nand $prefix/libs/gstreamer-$GST_API_VERSION/.\n$XDG_DATA_HOME defaults to\n$HOME/.local/share.\n\n\nthe cache may not contain information about a given file.\nthe cache may have stale information.\nthe cache may have current information.\n\n"});
