If the source sample is\nalready writable, this will simply return the same sample.\nUse this function to ensure that a sample can be safely modified before\nmaking changes to it, for example before calling gst_sample_set_buffer\nIf the reference count of the source sample sample is exactly one, the caller\nis the sole owner and this function will return the sample object unchanged.\nIf there is more than one reference on the object, a copy will be made using\ngst_sample_copy. The passed-in sample will be unreffed in that case, and the\ncaller will now own a reference to the new returned sample object.\nIn short, this function unrefs the sample in the argument and refs the sample\nthat it returns. Don't access the argument after calling this function unless\nyou have an additional reference to it.\nParameters:\nA GstSample\na writable sample which may or may not be the\nsame as sample\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.16\n\t\t\n"});
