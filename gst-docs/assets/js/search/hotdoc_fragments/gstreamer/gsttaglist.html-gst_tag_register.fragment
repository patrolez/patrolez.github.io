If a type\nwith that name is already registered, that one is used.\nThe old registration may have used a different type however. So don't rely\non your supplied values.\nImportant: if you do not supply a merge function the implication will be\nthat there can only be one single value for this tag in a tag list and\nany additional values will silently be discarded when being added (unless\nGST_TAG_MERGE_REPLACE, GST_TAG_MERGE_REPLACE_ALL, or\nGST_TAG_MERGE_PREPEND is used as merge mode, in which case the new\nvalue will replace the old one in the list).\nThe merge function will be called from gst_tag_list_copy_value when\nit is required that one or more values for a tag be condensed into\none single value. This may happen from gst_tag_list_get_string,\ngst_tag_list_get_int, gst_tag_list_get_double etc. What will happen\nexactly in that case depends on how the tag was registered and if a\nmerge function was supplied and if so which one.\nTwo default merge functions are provided: gst_tag_merge_use_first and\ngst_tag_merge_strings_with_comma.\nParameters:\nthe name or identifier string\na flag describing the type of tag info\nthe type this data is in\nhuman-readable name\na human-readable description about this tag\nfunction for merging multiple values of this tag, or NULL\n"});
