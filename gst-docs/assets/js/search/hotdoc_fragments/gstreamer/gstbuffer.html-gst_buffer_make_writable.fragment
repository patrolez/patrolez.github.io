If the source buffer is\nalready writable, this will simply return the same buffer.\nUse this function to ensure that a buffer can be safely modified before\nmaking changes to it, including changing the metadata such as PTS/DTS.\nIf the reference count of the source buffer buf is exactly one, the caller\nis the sole owner and this function will return the buffer object unchanged.\nIf there is more than one reference on the object, a copy will be made using\ngst_buffer_copy. The passed-in buf will be unreffed in that case, and the\ncaller will now own a reference to the new returned buffer object. Note\nthat this just copies the buffer structure itself, the underlying memory is\nnot copied if it can be shared amongst multiple buffers.\nIn short, this function unrefs the buf in the argument and refs the buffer\nthat it returns. Don't access the argument after calling this function unless\nyou have an additional reference to it.\nParameters:\na GstBuffer\na writable buffer (which may or may not be the\nsame as buf) or NULL if copying is required but not possible.\n"});
