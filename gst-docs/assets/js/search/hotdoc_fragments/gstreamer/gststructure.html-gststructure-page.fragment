fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gststructure.html#gststructure-page","fragment":"GstStructure\nA GstStructure is a collection of key/value pairs. The keys are expressed as\nGQuarks and the values can be of any GType.\nIn addition to the key/value pairs, a GstStructure also has a name. The name\nstarts with a letter and can be filled by letters, numbers and any of\n\"/-_.:\".\nGstStructure is used by various GStreamer subsystems to store information in\na flexible and extensible way. A GstStructure does not have a refcount\nbecause it usually is part of a higher level object such as GstCaps,\nGstMessage, GstEvent, GstQuery. It provides a means to enforce mutability\nusing the refcount of the parent with the gst_structure_set_parent_refcount\nmethod.\nA GstStructure can be created with gst_structure_new_empty or\ngst_structure_new, which both take a name and an optional set of key/value\npairs along with the types of the values.\nField values can be changed with gst_structure_set_value or\ngst_structure_set.\nField values can be retrieved with gst_structure_get_value or the more\nconvenient gst_structure_get_*() functions.\nFields can be removed with gst_structure_remove_field or\ngst_structure_remove_fields.\nStrings in structures must be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded. Other encodings are not\nallowed. Strings may be NULL however.\n"});
