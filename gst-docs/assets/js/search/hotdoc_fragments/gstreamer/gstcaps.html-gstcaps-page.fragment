They are also stored in the GstRegistry along with\na description of the GstElement.\nCaps are exposed on the element pads using the gst_pad_query_caps pad\nfunction. This function describes the possible types that the pad can\nhandle or produce at runtime.\nA GstCaps can be constructed with the following code fragment:\nA GstCaps is fixed when it has no fields with ranges or lists. Use\ngst_caps_is_fixed to test for fixed caps. Fixed caps can be used in a\ncaps event to notify downstream elements of the current media type.\nVarious methods exist to work with the media types such as subtracting\nor intersecting.\nBe aware that until 1.20 the GstCaps / GstStructure serialization into string\nhad limited support for nested GstCaps / GstStructure fields. It could only\nsupport one level of nesting. Using more levels would lead to unexpected\nbehavior when using serialization features, such as gst_caps_to_string or\ngst_value_serialize and their counterparts.\n"});
