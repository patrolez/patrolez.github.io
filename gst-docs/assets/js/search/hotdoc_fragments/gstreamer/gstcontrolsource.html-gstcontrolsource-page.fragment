A control source essentially is a\nfunction over time.\nA GstControlSource is used by first getting an instance of a specific\ncontrol-source, creating a binding for the control-source to the target property\nof the element and then adding the binding to the element. The binding will\nconvert the data types and value range to fit to the bound property.\nFor implementing a new GstControlSource one has to implement\nGstControlSourceGetValue and GstControlSourceGetValueArray functions.\nThese are then used by gst_control_source_get_value and\ngst_control_source_get_value_array to get values for specific timestamps.\n"});
