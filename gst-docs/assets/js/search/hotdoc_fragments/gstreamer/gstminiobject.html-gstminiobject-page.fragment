fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstminiobject.html#gstminiobject-page","fragment":"GstMiniObject\nGstMiniObject is a simple structure that can be used to implement refcounted\ntypes.\nSubclasses will include GstMiniObject as the first member in their structure\nand then call gst_mini_object_init to initialize the GstMiniObject fields.\ngst_mini_object_ref and gst_mini_object_unref increment and decrement the\nrefcount respectively. When the refcount of a mini-object reaches 0, the\ndispose function is called first and when this returns TRUE, the free\nfunction of the miniobject is called.\nA copy can be made with gst_mini_object_copy.\ngst_mini_object_is_writable will return TRUE when the refcount of the\nobject is exactly 1 and there is no parent or a single parent exists and is\nwritable itself, meaning the current caller has the only reference to the\nobject. gst_mini_object_make_writable will return a writable version of\nthe object, which might be a new copy when the refcount was not 1.\nOpaque data can be associated with a GstMiniObject with\ngst_mini_object_set_qdata and gst_mini_object_get_qdata. The data is\nmeant to be specific to the particular object and is not automatically copied\nwith gst_mini_object_copy or similar methods.\nA weak reference can be added and remove with gst_mini_object_weak_ref\nand gst_mini_object_weak_unref respectively.\n"});
