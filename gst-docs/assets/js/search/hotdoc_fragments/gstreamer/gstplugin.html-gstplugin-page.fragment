fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstplugin.html#gstplugin-page","fragment":"GstPlugin\nGStreamer is extensible, so GstElement instances can be loaded at runtime.\nA plugin system can provide one or more of the basic GStreamer\nGstPluginFeature subclasses.\nA plugin should export a symbol gst_plugin_desc that is a\nstruct of type GstPluginDesc.\nthe plugin loader will check the version of the core library the plugin was\nlinked against and will create a new GstPlugin. It will then call the\nGstPluginInitFunc function that was provided in the\ngst_plugin_desc.\nOnce you have a handle to a GstPlugin (e.g. from the GstRegistry), you\ncan add any object that subclasses GstPluginFeature.\nUsually plugins are always automatically loaded so you don't need to call\ngst_plugin_load explicitly to bring it into memory. There are options to\nstatically link plugins to an app or even use GStreamer without a plugin\nrepository in which case gst_plugin_load can be needed to bring the plugin\ninto memory.\n"});
