If this function\nreturns GST_FLOW_OK, the result buffer will be stored in buffer. The\ncontents of buffer is invalid for any other return value.\nThis function is installed on a source pad with\ngst_pad_set_getrange_function and can only be called on source pads after\nthey are successfully activated with gst_pad_activate_mode with the\nGST_PAD_MODE_PULL.\noffset and length are always given in byte units. offset must normally be a value\nbetween 0 and the length in bytes of the data available on pad. The\nlength (duration in bytes) can be retrieved with a GST_QUERY_DURATION or with a\nGST_QUERY_SEEKING.\nAny offset larger or equal than the length will make the function return\nGST_FLOW_EOS, which corresponds to EOS. In this case buffer does not\ncontain a valid buffer.\nThe buffer size of buffer will only be smaller than length when offset is\nnear the end of the stream. In all other cases, the size of buffer must be\nexactly the requested size.\nIt is allowed to call this function with a 0 length and valid offset, in\nwhich case buffer will contain a 0-sized buffer and the function returns\nGST_FLOW_OK.\nWhen this function is called with a -1 offset, the sequentially next buffer\nof length length in the stream is returned.\nWhen this function is called with a -1 length, a buffer with a default\noptimal length is returned in buffer.
