fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstobject.html#gstobject-page","fragment":"GstObject\nGstObject provides a root for the object hierarchy tree filed in by the\nGStreamer library.  It is currently a thin wrapper on top of\nGInitiallyUnowned. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own.\nGstObject gives us basic refcounting, parenting functionality and locking.\nMost of the functions are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be\nfound under the same name in the base class of GstObject which is GObject\n(e.g. g_object_ref becomes gst_object_ref).\nSince GstObject derives from GInitiallyUnowned, it also inherits the\nfloating reference. Be aware that functions such as gst_bin_add and\ngst_element_add_pad take ownership of the floating reference.\nIn contrast to GObject instances, GstObject adds a name property. The functions\ngst_object_set_name and gst_object_get_name are used to set/get the name\nof the object.\n"});
