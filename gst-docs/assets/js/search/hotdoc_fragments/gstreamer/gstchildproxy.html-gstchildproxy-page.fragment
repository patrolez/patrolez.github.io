Imagine elements such as mixers or polyphonic generators. They all\nhave multiple GstPad or some kind of voice objects. Another use case are\ncontainer elements like GstBin.\nThe element implementing the interface acts as a parent for those child\nobjects.\nBy implementing this interface the child properties can be accessed from the\nparent element by using gst_child_proxy_get and gst_child_proxy_set.\nProperty names are written as child-name::property-name. The whole naming\nscheme is recursive. Thus child1::child2::property is valid too, if\nchild1 and child2 implement the GstChildProxy interface.\n"});
