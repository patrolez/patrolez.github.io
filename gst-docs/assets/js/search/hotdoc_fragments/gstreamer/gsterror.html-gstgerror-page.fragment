As such, they should only inform about errors, and stop their\nprocessing.  In short, an element doesn't know what it is being used for.\nIt is the application or compound element using the given element that\nhas more context about the use of the element. Errors can be received by\nlistening to the GstBus of the element/pipeline for GstMessage objects with\nthe type GST_MESSAGE_ERROR or GST_MESSAGE_WARNING. The thrown errors should\nbe inspected, and filtered if appropriate.\nAn application is expected to, by default, present the user with a\ndialog box (or an equivalent) showing the error message.  The dialog\nshould also allow a way to get at the additional debug information,\nso the user can provide bug reporting information.\nA compound element is expected to forward errors by default higher up\nthe hierarchy; this is done by default in the same way as for other types\nof GstMessage.\nWhen applications or compound elements trigger errors that they can\nrecover from, they can filter out these errors and take appropriate action.\nFor example, an application that gets an error from xvimagesink\nthat indicates all XVideo ports are taken, the application can attempt\nto use another sink instead.\nElements throw errors using the GST_ELEMENT_ERROR convenience macro:\n\na domain type: CORE, LIBRARY, RESOURCE or STREAM\na code: an enum value specific to the domain\na translated, human-readable message\na non-translated additional debug string, which also contains\nfile and line information\n\n"});
