Examples of such elements are 'vorbisenc', 'theoraenc' and\n'id3v2mux'.\nIf you just want to retrieve metadata in your application then all you\nneed to do is watch for tag messages on your pipeline's bus. This\ninterface is only for setting metadata, not for extracting it. To set tags\nfrom the application, find tagsetter elements and set tags using e.g.\ngst_tag_setter_merge_tags or gst_tag_setter_add_tags. Also consider\nsetting the GstTagMergeMode that is used for tag events that arrive at the\ntagsetter element (default mode is to keep existing tags).\nThe application should do that before the element goes to GST_STATE_PAUSED.\nElements implementing the GstTagSetter interface often have to merge\nany tags received from upstream and the tags set by the application via\nthe interface. This can be done like this:\n"});
