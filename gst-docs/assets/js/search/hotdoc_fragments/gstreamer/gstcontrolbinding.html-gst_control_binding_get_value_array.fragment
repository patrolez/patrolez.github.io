The array values needs to hold enough space for n_values of\nthe same type as the objects property's type.\nThis function is useful if one wants to e.g. draw a graph of the control\ncurve or apply a control curve sample by sample.\nThe values are unboxed and ready to be used. The similar function\ngst_control_binding_get_g_value_array returns the array as GValue and is\nmore suitable for bindings.\nParameters:\nthe control binding\nthe time that should be processed\nthe time spacing between subsequent values\nthe number of values\narray to put control-values in\nTRUE if the given array could be filled, FALSE otherwise\n"});
