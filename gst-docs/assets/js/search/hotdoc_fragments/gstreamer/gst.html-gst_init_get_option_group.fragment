The\ngroup is set up to use standard GOption callbacks, so when using this\ngroup in combination with GOption parsing methods, all argument parsing\nand initialization is automated.\nThis function is useful if you want to integrate GStreamer with other\nlibraries that use GOption (see g_option_context_add_group ).\nIf you use this function, you should make sure you initialise the GLib\nthreading system as one of the very first things in your program\n(see the example at the beginning of this section).\na pointer to GStreamer's option group.\n"});
