fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstcaps.html#gst_caps_make_writable","fragment":"\n\tgst_caps_make_writable\n\nReturns a writable copy of caps.\nIf there is only one reference count on caps, the caller must be the owner,\nand so this function will return the caps object unchanged. If on the other\nhand there is more than one reference on the object, a new caps object will\nbe returned. The caller's reference on caps will be removed, and instead the\ncaller will own a reference to the returned object.\nIn short, this function unrefs the caps in the argument and refs the caps\nthat it returns. Don't access the argument after calling this function. See\nalso: gst_caps_ref.\nParameters:\na GstCaps\na writable caps which may or may not be the\nsame as caps\n"});
