fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstpreset.html#gstpreset-page","fragment":"GstPreset\nThis interface offers methods to query and manipulate parameter preset sets.\nA preset is a bunch of property settings, together with meta data and a name.\nThe name of a preset serves as key for subsequent method calls to manipulate\nsingle presets.\nAll instances of one type will share the list of presets. The list is created\non demand, if presets are not used, the list is not created.\nThe interface comes with a default implementation that serves most plugins.\nWrapper plugins will override most methods to implement support for the\nnative preset format of those wrapped plugins.\nOne method that is useful to be overridden is gst_preset_get_property_names.\nWith that one can control which properties are saved and in which order.\nWhen implementing support for read-only presets, one should set the vmethods\nfor gst_preset_save_preset and gst_preset_delete_preset to NULL.\nApplications can use gst_preset_is_editable to check for that.\nThe default implementation supports presets located in a system directory,\napplication specific directory and in the users home directory. When getting\na list of presets individual presets are read and overlaid in 1) system,\n2) application and 3) user order. Whenever an earlier entry is newer, the\nlater entries will be updated. Since 1.8 you can also provide extra paths\nwhere to find presets through the GST_PRESET_PATH environment variable.\nPresets found in those paths will be considered as \"app presets\".\n"});
