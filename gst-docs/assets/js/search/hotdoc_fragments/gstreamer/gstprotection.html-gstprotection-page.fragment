The demuxer would parse the\nprotection information for a video/audio frame from its input data and use\nthis information to populate the GstStructure info field,\nwhich is then encapsulated in a GstProtectionMeta object and attached to\nthe corresponding output buffer using the gst_buffer_add_protection_meta\nfunction. The information in this attached GstProtectionMeta would be\nused by a downstream decrypter element to recover the original unencrypted\nframe.\n"});
