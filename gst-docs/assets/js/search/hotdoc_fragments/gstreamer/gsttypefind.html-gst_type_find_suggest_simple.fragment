A GstTypeFindFunction may supply different suggestions\nin one call. It is up to the caller of the GstTypeFindFunction to interpret\nthese values.\nThis function is similar to gst_type_find_suggest, only that instead of\npassing a GstCaps argument you can create the caps on the fly in the same\nway as you can with gst_caps_new_simple.\nMake sure you terminate the list of arguments with a NULL argument and that\nthe values passed have the correct type (in terms of width in bytes when\npassed to the vararg function - this applies particularly to gdouble and\nguint64 arguments).\nParameters:\nThe GstTypeFind object the function was called with\nThe probability in percent that the suggestion is right\nthe media type of the suggested caps\nfirst field of the suggested caps, or NULL\nadditional arguments to the suggested caps in the same format as the\narguments passed to gst_structure_new (ie. triplets of field name,\nfield GType and field value).  If fieldname is NULL, this list\nmust be exactly one NULL.\n"});
