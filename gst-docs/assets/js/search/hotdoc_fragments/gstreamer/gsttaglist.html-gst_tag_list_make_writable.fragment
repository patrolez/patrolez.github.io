If on\nthe other hand there is more than one reference on the object, a new taglist\nobject will be returned (which will be a copy of taglist). The caller's\nreference on taglist will be removed, and instead the caller will own a\nreference to the returned object.\nIn short, this function unrefs the taglist in the argument and refs the\ntaglist that it returns. Don't access the argument after calling this\nfunction. See also: gst_tag_list_ref.\nParameters:\na GstTagList\na writable taglist which may or may not be the\nsame as taglist\n"});
