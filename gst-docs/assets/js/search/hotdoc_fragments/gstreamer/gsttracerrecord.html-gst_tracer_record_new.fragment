The record instance can be used to efficiently\nlog entries using gst_tracer_record_log.\nNULL terminator required after the last argument.\nThe name without the \".class\" suffix will be used for the log records.\nThere must be fields for each value that gets logged where the field name is\nthe value name. The field must be a GstStructure describing the value. The\nsub structure must contain a field called 'type' of G_TYPE_GTYPE that\ncontains the GType of the value. The resulting GstTracerRecord will take\nownership of the field structures.\nThe way to deal with optional values is to log an additional boolean before\nthe optional field, that if TRUE signals that the optional field is valid\nand FALSE signals that the optional field should be ignored. One must still\nlog a placeholder value for the optional field though. Please also note, that\npointer type values must not be NULL - the underlying serialisation can not\nhandle that right now.\nPlease note that this is still under discussion and subject to change.\nParameters:\nname of new record, must end on \".class\".\nname of first field to set\nadditional arguments\na new GstTracerRecord\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.8\n\t\t\n"});
