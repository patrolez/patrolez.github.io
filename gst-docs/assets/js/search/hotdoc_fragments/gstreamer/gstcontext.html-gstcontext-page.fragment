fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gstreamer/gstcontext.html#gstcontext-page","fragment":"GstContext\nGstContext is a container object used to store contexts like a device\ncontext, a display server connection and similar concepts that should\nbe shared between multiple elements.\nApplications can set a context on a complete pipeline by using\ngst_element_set_context, which will then be propagated to all\nchild elements. Elements can handle these in set_context\nand merge them with the context information they already have.\nWhen an element needs a context it will do the following actions in this\norder until one step succeeds:\nBins will catch GST_MESSAGE_NEED_CONTEXT messages and will set any previously\nknown context on the element that asks for it if possible. Otherwise the\napplication should provide one if it can.\nGstContext can be persistent.\nA persistent GstContext is kept in elements when they reach\nGST_STATE_NULL, non-persistent ones will be removed.\nAlso, a non-persistent context won't override a previous persistent\ncontext set to an element.\n"});
