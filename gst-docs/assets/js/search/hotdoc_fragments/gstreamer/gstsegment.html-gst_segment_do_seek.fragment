The new requested\nposition in the segment depends on rate and start_type and stop_type.\nFor positive rate, the new position in the segment is the new segment\nstart field when it was updated with a start_type different from\nGST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE. If no update was performed on segment start position\n(#GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE), start is ignored and segment position is\nunmodified.\nFor negative rate, the new position in the segment is the new segment\nstop field when it was updated with a stop_type different from\nGST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE. If no stop was previously configured in the segment, the\nduration of the segment will be used to update the stop position.\nIf no update was performed on segment stop position (#GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE),\nstop is ignored and segment position is unmodified.\nThe applied rate of the segment will be set to 1.0 by default.\nIf the caller can apply a rate change, it should update segment\nrate and applied_rate after calling this function.\nupdate will be set to TRUE if a seek should be performed to the segment\nposition field.
