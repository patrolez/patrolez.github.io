The only thing\nthat this class actually does is that it watches the pipeline bus for\nmessages and forwards them to the master pipeline through the ipcpipelinesrc\nelements that it contains.\nFor more details about this mechanism and its uses, see the documentation\nof the ipcpipelinesink element.\n"});
