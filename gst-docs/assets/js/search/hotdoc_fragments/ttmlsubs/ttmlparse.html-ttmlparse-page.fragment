Currently, only the EBU-TT-D profile of TTML, designed for\ndistribution of subtitles over IP, is supported.\nThe parser outputs a GstBuffer for each scene in the input TTML file, a\nscene being a period of time during which a static set of subtitles should\nbe visible. The parser places each text element within a scene into its own\nGstMemory within the scene's buffer, and attaches metadata to the buffer\ndescribing the styling and layout associated with all the contained text\nelements. A downstream renderer element uses this information to correctly\nrender the text on top of video frames.\n"});
