This contains the\naddress of the intended streaming server. However some servers return an\n\"invalid\" address. Here follows two examples when it might happen.\nA server uses Apache combined with a separate RTSP process to handle\nHTTPS requests on port 443. In this case Apache handles TLS and\nconnects to the local RTSP server, which results in a local\naddress 127.0.0.1 or ::1 in the header reply. This address is\nreturned to the actual RTSP client in the header. The client will\nreceive this address and try to connect to it and fail.\nThe client uses an IPv6 link local address with a specified scope id\nfe80::aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd%eth0 and connects via HTTP on port 80.\nThe RTSP server receives the connection and returns the address\nin the x-server-ip-address header. The client will receive this\naddress and try to connect to it \"as is\" without the scope id and\nfail.\nIn the case of streaming data from RTSP servers like 1 and 2, it's\nuseful to have the option to simply ignore the x-server-ip-address\nheader reply and continue using the original address.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\tfalse\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.20\n\t\t\n"});
