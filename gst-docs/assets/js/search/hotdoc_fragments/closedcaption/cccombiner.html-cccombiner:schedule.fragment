In\nthat case the element will start dropping old caption buffers once\nthe number of buffers in its internal queue reaches\nmax-scheduled.\nWhen this is set to FALSE, the behaviour of this element is essentially\nthat of a funnel.\n\n\tFlags :\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWrite\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tDefault value :\ttrue\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.20\n\t\t\n"});
