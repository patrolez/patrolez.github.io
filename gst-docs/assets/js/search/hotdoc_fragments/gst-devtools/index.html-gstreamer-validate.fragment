It was first\nstarted to provide plug-ins developers with a tool to check that they\nuse the framework the proper way.\nGstValidate implements a monitoring logic that allows the system to\ncheck that the elements of a GstPipeline respect some rules GStreamer\ncomponents have to follow to make them properly interact together. For\nexample, a GstValidatePadMonitor will make sure that if we receive a\nGstSegment from upstream, an equivalent segment is sent downstream\nbefore any buffer gets out.\nThen GstValidate implements a reporting system that allows users to get\ndetailed informations about what was not properly handled by the\nelements. The generated reports are ordered by level of importance from\n\"issue\" to \"critical\".\nSome tools have been implemented to help developers validate and test\ntheir GstElement, see gst-validate for example.\nOn top of that, the notion of a validation scenario\nhas been implemented so that developers can easily execute a set of actions on\npipelines to test real world interactive cases and reproduce existing\nissues in a convenient way.\n"});
