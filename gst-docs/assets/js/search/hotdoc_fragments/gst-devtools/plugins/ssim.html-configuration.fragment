fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-devtools/plugins/ssim.html#configuration","fragment":"Configuration\nThe configuration of the plugin is done through a validate configuration file,\nspecified with the %GST_VALIDATE_CONFIG environment variable. Each line starting\nwith 'ssim,' will configure the ssim plugin. In practice each configuration statement\nwill lead to the creation of a #GstValidateOverride object which will then dump\nimage files and if wanted compare those with a set of reference images.\nThe following parameters can be passed in the configuration file:\n\nelement-classification: The target element classification as define in\ngst_element_class_set_metadata\noutput-dir: The directory in which the image files will be saved\nmin-avg-priority: (default 0.95): The minimum average similarity\nunder which we consider the test as failing\nmin-lowest-priority: (default 1): The minimum 'lowest' similarity\nunder which we consider the test as failing\nreference-images-dir: Define the directory in which the files to be\ncompared can be found\nresult-output-dir: The folder in which to store resulting grey scale\nimages when the test failed. In that folder you will find images\nwith the structural difference between the expected result and the actual\nresult.\noutput-video-format: The format in which you want the images to be saved\nreference-video-format: The format in which the reference images are stored\ncheck-recurrence: The recurrence in seconds (as float) the frames should\nbe dumped and checked.By default it is GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE, meaning each\nand every frame is checked. Not that in any case, after a discontinuity\nin the stream (after a seek or a change in the video format for example)\na check is done. And if recurrence == 0, images will be checked only after\nsuch discontinuity\nis-config: Property letting the plugin know that the config line is exclusively\nused to configure the following configuration expressions. In practice this\nmeans that it will change the default values for the other configuration\nexpressions.\nframerate: (GstFraction): The framerate to use to compute frame number from\ntimestamp, allowing to compare frames by 'frame number' instead of trying to\nmatch timestamp between reference images and output images.\n\n"});
