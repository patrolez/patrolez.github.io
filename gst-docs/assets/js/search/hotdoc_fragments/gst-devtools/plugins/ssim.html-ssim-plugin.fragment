fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-devtools/plugins/ssim.html#ssim-plugin","fragment":"SSIM plugin\nGstValidate plugin to run the ssim algorithm on the buffers flowing in the\npipeline to find regressions and detect frame corruptions.\nIt allows you to generate image files from the buffers flowing in the pipeline\n(either as raw in the many formats supported by GStreamer or as png) and then\ncheck them against pre generated, reference images.\nThe ssim algorithm will set a value of 1.0 when images are perfectly identical,\nand -1.0 if they have nothing in common. By default we consider images as similar\nif they have at least a ssim value of 0.95 but you can override it defining the value\nunder which the test will be considered as failed.\nErrors are reported on the GstValidate reporting system. You can also ask\nthe plugin to  generate grey scale output images. Those will be named in a way\nthat should lets you precisely see where and how the test failed.\n"});
