fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-devtools/gst-validate-flow.html#description","fragment":"Description\nThis component exists for the purpose of testing non-regular-playback use cases\nwhere the test author specifies the full pipeline, a series of actions and needs\nto check whether the generated buffers and events make sense.\nThe testing procedure goes like this:\nThe test author writes a .validatetest test\nwhere validateflow is used. A pad where monitoring will occur is specified\nand possibly a list of actions to run can\nalso be specified.\nThe test author runs the test with the desired pipeline, the configuration\nand the actions. Since an expectation file does not exist at\nthis point, validateflow will create one. The author should check its\ncontents for any missing or unwanted events. No actual checking is done by\nvalidateflow in this step, since there is nothing to compare to yet.\nFurther executions of the test will also record the produced buffers and\nevents, but now they will be compared to the previous log (expectation file).\nAny difference will be reported as a test failure. The original expectation\nfile is never modified by validateflow. Any desired changes can be made by\nediting the file manually or deleting it and running the test again.\n"});
