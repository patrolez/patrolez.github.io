fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-devtools/gst-validate-flow.html#scenario-actions","fragment":"Scenario actions\nScenarios with validateflow work in the same way as other tests. Often\nvalidatetests will use appsrc in order to control the flow of data precisely,\npossibly interleaving events in between. The following is a list of useful\nactions.\nMore details on these actions can be queried from the command line, like this:\n\n\nappsrc-push: Pushes a buffer from an appsrc element and waits for the chain\noperation to finish. A path to a file is provided, optionally with an offset\nand/or size.\n\nappsrc-eos: Queues an EOS event from the appsrc. The action finishes\nimmediately at this point.\n\nstop: Tears down the pipeline and stops the test.\n\ncheckpoint: Records a \"checkpoint\" message in all validateflow overrides,\nwith an optional explanation message. This is useful to check certain events\nor buffers are sent at a specific moment in the scenario, and can also help\nto the comprehension of the scenario.\n\n"});
