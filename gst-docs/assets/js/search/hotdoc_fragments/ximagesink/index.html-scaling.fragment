fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"ximagesink/index.html#scaling","fragment":"Scaling\nAs standard XImage rendering to a drawable is not scaled, XImageSink will use\nreverse caps negotiation to try to get scaled video frames for the drawable.\nThis is accomplished by asking the peer pad if it accepts some different caps\nwhich in most cases implies that there is a scaling element in the pipeline,\nor that an element generating the video frames can generate them with a\ndifferent geometry. This mechanism is handled during buffer allocations, for\neach allocation request the video sink will check the drawable geometry, look\nat the force-aspect-ratio property, calculate the geometry of\ndesired video frames and then check that the peer pad accept those new caps.\nIf it does it will then allocate a buffer in video memory with this new\ngeometry and return it with the new caps.\n"});
