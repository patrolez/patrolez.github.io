Once this connection is open it will inspect\nthe display configuration including the physical display geometry and\nthen calculate the pixel aspect ratio. When caps negotiation will occur, the\nvideo sink will set the calculated pixel aspect ratio on the caps to make\nsure that incoming video frames will have the correct pixel aspect ratio for\nthis display. Sometimes the calculated pixel aspect ratio can be wrong, it is\nthen possible to enforce a specific pixel aspect ratio using the\npixel-aspect-ratio property.\n"});
