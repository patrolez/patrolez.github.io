That means this element may introduce additional\nlatency for the DTS decision.\nThis element can be useful if downstream elements require correct DTS\ninformation but upstream elements either do not provide it at all or the\nupstream DTS information is unreliable.\nFor example, mp4 muxers typically require both DTS and PTS on the input\nbuffers, but in case where the input H.265 data comes from Matroska files or\nRTP/RTSP streams DTS timestamps may be absent and this element may need to\nbe used to clean up the DTS timestamps before handing it to the mp4 muxer.\nThis is particularly the case where the H.265 stream contains B-frames\n(i.e. frame reordering is required), as streams without correct DTS information\nwill confuse the muxer element and will result in unexpected (or bogus)\nduration/framerate/timestamp values in the muxed container stream.\n"});
