fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"interleave/interleave.html#interleave-page","fragment":"interleave\nMerges separate mono inputs into one interleaved stream.\nThis element handles all raw floating point sample formats and all signed integer sample formats. The first\ncaps on one of the sinkpads will set the caps of the output so usually an audioconvert element should be\nplaced before every sinkpad of interleave.\nIt's possible to change the number of channels while the pipeline is running by adding or removing\nsome of the request pads but this will change the caps of the output buffers. Changing the input\ncaps is not supported yet.\nThe channel number of every sinkpad in the out can be retrieved from the \"channel\" property of the pad.\n"});
