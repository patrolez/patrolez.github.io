fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"avtp/index.html#clock-reference-format-crf","fragment":"Clock Reference Format (CRF)\nEven though the systems are synchronized by PTP, it is possible that\ndifferent talkers can send media streams which are out of phase or the\nfrequencies do not exactly match. This is partcularly important when there\nis a single listener processing data from multiple talkers. The systems in\nthis scenario can benefit if a common clock is distributed among the\nsystems.\nThis can be achieved by using the avtpcrfsync element which implements CRF\nas described in Chapter 10 of IEEE 1722-2016. avtpcrfcheck can also be used\nto validate that the adjustment conforms to the criteria specified in the\nspec. For further details, look at the documentation for the respective\nelements.\n"});
