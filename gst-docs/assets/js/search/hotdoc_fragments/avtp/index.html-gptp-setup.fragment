fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"avtp/index.html#gptp-setup","fragment":"gPTP Setup\nThe Linuxptp project provides the ptp4l daemon, which synchronizes the PTP\nclock from NIC, and the pmc tool which communicates with ptp4l to get/set\nsome runtime settings. The project also provides the phc2sys daemon which\nsynchronizes the PTP clock and system clock.\nThe AVTP plugin requires system clock is synchronized with PTP clock and\nTAI offset is properly set in the kernel. ptp4l and phc2sys can be set up\nin many different ways, below we provide an example that fullfils the plugin\nrequirements. For further information check ptp4l(8) and phc2sys(8).\nIn the following instructions, replace $IFNAME by your PTP capable NIC\ninterface. The gPTP.cfg file mentioned below can be found in /usr/share/\ndoc/linuxptp/ (depending on your distro).\nSynchronize PTP clock with PTP time:\nEnable TAI offset to be automatically set by phc2sys:\nSynchronize system clock with PTP clock:\nThe commands above should be run on both AVTP Talker and Listener hosts.\nWith clocks properly synchronized, applications using the AVTP plugin\nshould use GstSytemClock with GST_CLOCK_TYPE_REALTIME as the pipeline\nclock.\n"});
