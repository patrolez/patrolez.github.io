As GStreamer has a GstPtpClock, using it should be\nthe simplest way of achieving that.\nHowever, as there's no way of forcing a clock to a pipeline using\ngst-launch-1.0 application, even for quick tests, it's necessary to have\nan application. One can refer to GStreamer \"hello world\" application,\nremembering to set the pipeline clock to GstPtpClock before putting the\npipeline on \"PLAYING\" state. Some code like:\nWould do the trick.\n"});
