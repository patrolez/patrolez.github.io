Below we provide an example to configure those qdiscs\nin order to transmit a CVF H.264 stream 1280x720@30fps. For further\ninformation on how to configure these qdiscs check tc-mqprio(8) and\ntc-cbs(8) man pages.\nOn the host that will run as AVTP Talker (pipeline that generates the video\nstream), run the following commands:\nConfigure mpqrio qdisc (replace $MQPRIO_HANDLE_ID by an unused handle ID):\nConfigure cbs qdisc (replace $CBS_HANDLE_ID by an unused handle ID):\nAlso, the plugin implements a transmission scheduling mechanism that relies\non ETF qdisc so make sure it is properly configured in your system. It could\nbe configured in many ways, below follows an example.\nNo Traffic Control configuration is required at the host running as AVTP\nListener.\n"});
