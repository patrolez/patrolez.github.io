Basic properties are:\nstreamid (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay, avtprvfdepay, avtpcvfdepay,\navtprvfdepay, avtpcrfsync, avtpcrfcheck): Stream ID associated with the\nstream.\nifname (avtpsink, avtpsrc, avtpcrfsync, avtpcrfcheck): Network interface\nused to send/receive AVTP packets.\ndst-macaddr (avtpsink, avtpsrc): Destination MAC address for the stream.\npriority (avtpsink): Priority used by the plugin to transmit AVTP\ntraffic.\nmtt (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay): Maximum Transit Time, in\nnanoseconds, as defined in AVTP spec.\ntu (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay): Maximum Time Uncertainty, in\nnanoseconds, as defined in AVTP spec.\nprocessing-deadline (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay, avtpsink):\nMaximum amount of time, in nanoseconds, that the pipeline is expected to\nprocess any buffer. This value should be in sync between the one used on\nthe payloader and the sink, as this time is also taken into consideration\nto define the correct presentation time of the packets on the AVTP listener\nside. It should be as low as possible (zero if possible).\ntimestamp-mode (avtpaafpay): AAF timestamping mode, as defined in AVTP spec.\nmtu (avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay): Maximum Transmit Unit of the underlying network,\nused to determine when to fragment a RVF/CVF packet and how big it should be.\nCheck each element documentation for more details.\n\n\nstreamid (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay, avtprvfdepay, avtpcvfdepay,\navtprvfdepay, avtpcrfsync, avtpcrfcheck): Stream ID associated with the\nstream.\n\n\nifname (avtpsink, avtpsrc, avtpcrfsync, avtpcrfcheck): Network interface\nused to send/receive AVTP packets.\n\n\ndst-macaddr (avtpsink, avtpsrc): Destination MAC address for the stream.\n\n\npriority (avtpsink): Priority used by the plugin to transmit AVTP\ntraffic.\n\n\nmtt (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay): Maximum Transit Time, in\nnanoseconds, as defined in AVTP spec.\n\n\ntu (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay): Maximum Time Uncertainty, in\nnanoseconds, as defined in AVTP spec.\n\n\nprocessing-deadline (avtpaafpay, avtprvfpay, avtpcvfpay, avtpsink):\nMaximum amount of time, in nanoseconds, that the pipeline is expected to\nprocess any buffer.
