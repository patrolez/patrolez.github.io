fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"allocators/gstshmallocator.html#gstshmallocator-page","fragment":"GstShmAllocator\nThis is a subclass of GstFdAllocator that implements the\ngst_allocator_alloc method using memfd_create() when available, POSIX\nshm_open() otherwise. Platforms not supporting any of those (Windows) will\nalways return NULL.\nNote that allocating new shared memories has a significant performance cost,\nit is thus recommended to keep a pool of pre-allocated GstMemory, using\nGstBufferPool. For that reason, this allocator has the\nGST_ALLOCATOR_FLAG_NO_COPY flag set.\n"});
