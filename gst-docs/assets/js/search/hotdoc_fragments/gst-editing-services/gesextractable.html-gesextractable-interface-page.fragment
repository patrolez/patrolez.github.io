By default, the requested asset\nid will be ignored by a GESExtractable and will be set to\nthe type name of the extractable instead. Also by default, when the\nrequested asset is extracted, the returned object will simply be a\nnewly created default object of that extractable type. You should check\nthe documentation for each extractable type to see if they differ from\nthe default.\nAfter the object is extracted, it will have a reference to the asset it\ncame from, which you can retrieve using ges_extractable_get_asset.\n"});
