In particular,\nges_meta_container_set_meta can be used to store any GValue under\nany generic field (specified by a string key). The same method can also\nbe used to remove the field by passing NULL. A number of convenience\nmethods are also provided to make it easier to set common value types.\nThe metadata can then be read with ges_meta_container_get_meta and\nsimilar convenience methods.\n"});
