A\nGESClip will have its timeline set through its\nGESLayer. A GESTrack will similarly take care of setting the\ntimeline of its GESTrackElement-s. A GESGroup\nwill adopt the same timeline as its children.\nIf timeline is NULL, this will stop its current\ntimeline from tracking it, otherwise timeline will\nstart tracking self. Note, in the latter case, self must not already\nhave a timeline set. Therefore, if you wish to switch timelines, you\nwill need to call this function twice: first to set the timeline to\nNULL, and then to the new timeline.\nParameters:\nA GESTimelineElement\ntimeline (nullable): The GESTimeline self should be in\nTRUE if timeline could be set for self.\nSets the timeline of the element.\nThis is used internally and you should normally not call this.
