A\nminimalistic timeline would only have one layer, but a more complex\nediting application could use as many as needed.\nTracks - Corresponds to the output streams in GStreamer. A typical\nGESTimeline, aimed at a video editing application, would have an\naudio track and a video track. A GESTimeline for an audio editing\napplication would only require an audio track. Multiple layers can\nbe related to each track.\n\nIn order to reduce even more the amount of GStreamer interaction the\napplication developer has to deal with, a convenience GstPipeline has\nbeen made available specifically for Timelines : GESPipeline.\n\n\nLayers - Corresponds to the user-visible arrangement of clips, and\nwhat you primarily interact with as an application developer.
