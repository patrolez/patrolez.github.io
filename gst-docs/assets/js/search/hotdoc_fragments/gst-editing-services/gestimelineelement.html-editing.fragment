fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gestimelineelement.html#editing","fragment":"Editing\nElements can be moved around in their timeline by\nsetting their start and\nduration using ges_timeline_element_set_start\nand ges_timeline_element_set_duration. Additionally, which parts of\nthe underlying content are played in the timeline can be adjusted by\nsetting the in-point using\nges_timeline_element_set_inpoint. The library also provides\nges_timeline_element_edit, with various GESEditMode-s, which can\nadjust these properties in a convenient way, as well as introduce\nsimilar changes in neighbouring or later elements in the timeline.\nHowever, a timeline may refuse a change in these properties if they\nwould place the timeline in an unsupported configuration. See\nGESTimeline for its overlap rules.\nAdditionally, an edit may be refused if it would place one of the\ntiming properties out of bounds (such as a negative time value for\nstart, or having insufficient internal\ncontent to last for the desired duration).\n"});
