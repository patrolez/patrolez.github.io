Its\nstart and duration specify its\ntemporal extent in the track. Specifically, a track element wraps some\nnleobject, such as an NleSource or nleoperation, which can be\nretrieved with ges_track_element_get_nleobject, and its\nstart, duration,\nin-point, priority and\nactive properties expose the corresponding nleobject\nproperties. When a track element is added to a track, its nleobject is\nadded to the corresponding nlecomposition that the track wraps.\nMost users will not have to work directly with track elements since a\nGESClip will automatically create track elements for its timeline's\ntracks and take responsibility for updating them. The only track\nelements that are not automatically created by clips, but a user is\nlikely to want to create, are GESEffect-s.\n"});
