A layer with the\nindex/priority 0 will have the highest priority and the layer with the\nlargest index will have the lowest priority (the order of priorities,\nin this sense, is the _reverse_ of the numerical ordering of the\nindices). ges_timeline_move_layer should be used if you wish to\nchange how layers are prioritised in a timeline.\nLayers with higher priorities will have their content priorities\nover content from lower priority layers, similar to how layers are\nused in image editing. For example, if two separate layers both\ndisplay video content, then the layer with the higher priority will\nhave its images shown first. The other layer will only have its image\nshown if the higher priority layer has no content at the given\nplaytime, or is transparent in some way. Audio content in separate\nlayers will simply play in addition.\n"});
