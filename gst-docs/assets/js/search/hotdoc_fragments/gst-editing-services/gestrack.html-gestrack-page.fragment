Each one\nessentially provides an additional GstPad for the timeline, with\nrestriction-caps capabilities. Internally, a track\nwraps an nlecomposition filtered by a capsfilter.\nA track will contain a number of GESTrackElement-s, and its role is\nto select and activate these elements according to their timings when\nthe timeline in played. For example, a track would activate a\nGESSource when its start is reached by outputting\nits data for its duration. Similarly, a\nGESOperation would be activated by applying its effect to the source\ndata, starting from its start time and lasting for\nits duration.\nFor most users, it will usually be sufficient to add newly created\ntracks to a timeline, but never directly add an element to a track.\nWhenever a GESClip is added to a timeline, the clip adds its\nelements to the timeline's tracks and assumes responsibility for\nupdating them.\n"});
