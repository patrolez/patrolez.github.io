That is,\nit was created by the create_track_elements GESClipClass method for\nsome GESClip.\nNote that such a track element can only be added to a clip that shares\nthe same GESAsset as the clip that created it. For example, you are\nallowed to move core children between clips that resulted from\nges_container_ungroup, but you could not move the core child from a\nGESUriClip to a GESTitleClip or another GESUriClip with a different\nuri.\nMoreover, if a core track element is added to a clip, it will always be\nadded as a core child. Therefore, if this returns TRUE, then element\nwill be a core child of its parent clip.\nParameters:\nA GESTrackElement\nTRUE if element is a core track element.\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.18\n\t\t\nGet whether the given track element is a core track element.
