These will be enforced by\nGES, so the user will not need to keep track of them, but they should\nbe aware that certain edits will be refused as a result if the overlap\nrules would be broken.\nConsider two GESSource-s, A and B, with start times startA and\nstartB, and end times endA and endB, respectively. The start\ntime refers to their start, and the end time is\ntheir start + duration. These\ntwo sources overlap if:\nNote that when startA = endB or startB = endA then the two sources\nwill touch at their edges, but are not considered overlapping.\nIf, in addition, startA < startB < endA, then we can say that the\nend of A overlaps the start of B.\nIf, instead, startA <= startB and endA >= endB, then we can say\nthat A fully overlaps B.\nThe overlap rules for a timeline are that:\nThe last two rules combined essentially mean that at any given timeline\nposition, only up to two GESSource-s may overlap at that position. So\ntriple or more overlaps are not allowed.\nIf you switch on auto-transition, then at any moment when\nthe end of one source (the first source) overlaps the start of another\n(the second source), a GESTransitionClip will be automatically created\nfor the pair in the same layer and it will cover their overlap. If the\ntwo elements are edited in a way such that the end of the first source\nno longer overlaps the start of the second, the transition will be\nautomatically removed from the timeline. However, if the two sources\nstill overlap at the same edges after the edit, then the same\ntransition object will be kept, but with its timing and layer adjusted\naccordingly.\nNOTE: if you know what you are doing and want to be in full control of the\ntimeline layout, you can disable the edit APIs with\nges_timeline_disable_edit_apis.\n\nthey share the same track (non NULL), which belongs\nto the timeline;\nthey share the same GES_TIMELINE_ELEMENT_LAYER_PRIORITY; and\n\nstartA < endB and startB < endA.\n\n"});
