If it is not a\ncore child (an additional effect), then it must be added to a track\nthat already contains one of the core children of the same clip.\nThis method can also fail if the adding the track element to the track\nwould break a configuration rule of the corresponding GESTimeline,\nsuch as causing three sources to overlap at a single time, or causing\na source to completely overlap another in the same track.\nParameters:\nA GESClip\nA child of clip\nThe track to add child to\nReturn location for an error\nThe element that was added to track, either\nchild or a copy of child, or NULL if the element could not be added.\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.18\n\t\t\nAdds the track element child of the clip to a specific track.\nIf the given child is already in another track, this will create a copy\nof the child, add it to the clip, and add this copy to the track.\nYou should only call this whilst a clip is part of a GES.Timeline, and\nfor tracks that are in the same timeline.\nThis method is an alternative to using the\nselect-tracks-for-object signal, but can be used to\ncomplement it when, say, you wish to copy a clip's children from one\ntrack into a new one.\nWhen the child is a core child, it must be added to a track that does\nnot already contain another core child of the same clip.
