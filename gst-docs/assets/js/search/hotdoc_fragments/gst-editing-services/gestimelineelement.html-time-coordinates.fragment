fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gestimelineelement.html#time-coordinates","fragment":"Time Coordinates\nThere are three main sets of time coordinates to consider when using\ntimeline elements:\nYou can determine the timeline time for a given internal source time\nin a GESTrack in a GESClip using\nges_clip_get_timeline_time_from_internal_time, and vice versa using\nges_clip_get_internal_time_from_timeline_time, for the purposes of\nediting and setting timings properties.\n\nTimeline coordinates: these are the time coordinates used in the\noutput of the timeline in its GESTrack-s. Each track share the same\ncoordinates, so there is only one set of coordinates for the\ntimeline. These extend indefinitely from 0. The times used for\nediting (including setting start and\nduration) use these coordinates, since these\ndefine when an element is present and for how long the element lasts\nfor in the timeline.\nInternal source coordinates: these are the time coordinates used\ninternally at the element's output. This is only really defined for\nGESTrackElement-s, where it refers to time coordinates used at the\nfinal source pad of the wrapped GstElement-s. However, these\ncoordinates may also be used in a GESClip in reference to its\nchildren. In particular, these are the coordinates used for\nin-point and max-duration.\nInternal sink coordinates: these are the time coordinates used\ninternally at the element's input. A GESSource has no input, so\nthese would be undefined. Otherwise, for most GESTrackElement-s\nthese will be the same set of coordinates as the internal source\ncoordinates because the element does not change the timing\ninternally. Only GESBaseEffect can support elements where these\nare different. See GESBaseEffect for more information.\n\n"});
