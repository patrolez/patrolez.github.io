fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gesbaseeffect.html#time-effects","fragment":"Time Effects\nSome operations will change the timing of the stream data they receive\nin some way. In particular, the GstElement that they wrap could alter\nthe times of the segment they receive in a GST_EVENT_SEGMENT event,\nor the times of a seek they receive in a GST_EVENT_SEEK event. Such\noperations would be considered time effects since they translate the\ntimes they receive on their source to different times at their sink,\nand vis versa. This introduces two sets of time coordinates for the\nevent: (internal) sink coordinates and (internal) source coordinates,\nwhere segment times are translated from the sink coordinates to the\nsource coordinates, and seek times are translated from the source\ncoordinates to the sink coordinates.\nIf you use such an effect in GES, you will need to inform GES of the\nproperties that control the timing with\nges_base_effect_register_time_property, and the effect's timing\nbehaviour using ges_base_effect_set_time_translation_funcs.\nNote that a time effect should not have its\nhas-internal-source set to TRUE.\nIn addition, note that GES only fully supports time effects whose\nmapping from the source to sink coordinates (those applied to seeks)\nobeys:\nNote that a constant-rate-change effect that is not extremely fast or\nslow would satisfy these conditions. For such effects, you may wish to\nuse ges_effect_class_register_rate_property.\n\nMaps the time 0 to 0. So initial time-shifting effects are\nexcluded.\nIs monotonically increasing. So reversing effects, and effects that\njump backwards in the stream are excluded.\nCan handle a reasonable GstClockTime, relative to the project. So\nthis would exclude a time effect with an extremely large speed-up\nthat would cause the converted GstClockTime seeks to overflow.\nIs 'continuously reversible'. This essentially means that for every\ntime in the sink coordinates, we can, to 'good enough' accuracy,\ncalculate the corresponding time in the source coordinates. Moreover,\nthis should correspond to how segment times are translated from\nsink to source.\nOnly depends on the registered time properties, rather than the\nstate of the GstElement or the data it receives. This would exclude,\nsay, an effect that would speedup if there is more red in the image\nit receives.\n\n"});
