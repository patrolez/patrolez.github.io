If track is given as NULL and track_type is given as\nGES_TRACK_TYPE_UNKNOWN, then the search will match all elements in any\ntrack, including those with no track, and of any\ntrack-type. Otherwise, if track is not NULL, but\ntrack_type is GES_TRACK_TYPE_UNKNOWN, then only the track elements in\ntrack are searched for. Otherwise, if track_type is not\nGES_TRACK_TYPE_UNKNOWN, but track is NULL, then only the track\nelements whose track-type matches track_type are\nsearched for. Otherwise, when both are given, the track elements that\nmatch either criteria are searched for. Therefore, if you wish to\nonly find elements in a specific track, you should give the track as\ntrack, but you should not give the track's track-type as\ntrack_type because this would also select elements from other tracks\nof the same type.\nYou may also give type to further restrict the search to track\nelements of the given type.\nParameters:\nA GESClip\nThe track to search in, or NULL to search in\nall tracks\nThe track-type of the track element to search for, or\nGES_TRACK_TYPE_UNKNOWN to match any track type\nThe type of track element to search for, or G_TYPE_NONE to\nmatch any type\nA list of all\nthe GESTrackElement-s controlled by clip, in track or of the given\ntrack_type, and of the given type.\nFinds the GES.TrackElement-s controlled by the clip that match the\ngiven criteria.
