In particular, it is\nresponsible for maintaining the relative start and\nduration times of its children. Therefore, if a\ncontainer is temporally adjusted or moved to a new layer, it may\naccordingly adjust and move its children. Similarly, a change in one of\nits children may prompt the parent to correspondingly change its\nsiblings.\n"});
