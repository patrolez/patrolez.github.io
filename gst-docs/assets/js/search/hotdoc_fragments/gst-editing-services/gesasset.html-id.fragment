fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gesasset.html#id","fragment":"ID\nEach asset is uniquely defined in the cache by its\nextractable-type and id. Depending on the\nextractable-type, the id can be used to parametrise\nthe creation of the object upon extraction. By default, a class that\nimplements GESExtractable will only have a single associated asset,\nwith an id set to the type name of its objects. However, this\nis overwritten by some implementations, which allow a class to have\nmultiple associated assets. For example, for GESTransitionClip the\nid will be a nickname of the vtype. You\nshould check the documentation for each extractable type to see if they\ndiffer from the default.\nMoreover, each extractable-type may also associate itself\nwith a specific asset subclass. In such cases, when their asset is\nrequested, an asset of this subclass will be returned instead.\n"});
