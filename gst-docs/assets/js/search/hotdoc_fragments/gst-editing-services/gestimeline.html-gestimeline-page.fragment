fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gestimeline.html#gestimeline-page","fragment":"GESTimeline\nGESTimeline is the central object for any multimedia timeline.\nA timeline is composed of a set of GESTrack-s and a set of\nGESLayer-s, which are added to the timeline using\nges_timeline_add_track and ges_timeline_append_layer, respectively.\nThe contained tracks define the supported types of the timeline\nand provide the media output. Essentially, each track provides an\nadditional source GstPad.\nMost usage of a timeline will likely only need a single GESAudioTrack\nand/or a single GESVideoTrack. You can create such a timeline with\nges_timeline_new_audio_video. After this, you are unlikely to need to\nwork with the tracks directly.\nA timeline's layers contain GESClip-s, which in turn control the\ncreation of GESTrackElement-s, which are added to the timeline's\ntracks. See select-tracks-for-object if you wish to have\nmore control over which track a clip's elements are added to.\nThe layers are ordered, with higher priority layers having their\ncontent prioritised in the tracks. This ordering can be changed using\nges_timeline_move_layer.\n"});
