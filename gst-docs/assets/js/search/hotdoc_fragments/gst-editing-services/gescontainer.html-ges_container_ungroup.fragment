The rules for how the\ncontainer splits depends on the subclass. A GESGroup will simply split\ninto its children. A GESClip will split into one GESClip per\nGESTrackType it overlaps with (so an audio-video clip will split into\nan audio clip and a video clip), where each clip contains all the\nGESTrackElement-s from the original clip with a matching\ntrack-type.\nIf recursive is TRUE, and the container contains other containers as\nchildren, then they will also be ungrouped, and so on.\nParameters:\nThe container to ungroup\nWhether to recursively ungroup container\nThe list of\nnew GESContainer-s created from the splitting of container.\nUngroups the container by splitting it into several containers\ncontaining various children of the original.
