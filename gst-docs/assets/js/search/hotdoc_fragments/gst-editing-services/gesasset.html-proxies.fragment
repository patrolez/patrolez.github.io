When the original asset is requested from the cache, the proxy\nwill be returned in its place. This can be useful if, say, you want\nto substitute a GESUriClipAsset corresponding to a high resolution\nmedia file with the asset of a lower resolution stand in.\nAn asset may even have several proxies, the first of which will act as\nits default and be returned on requests, but the others will be ordered\nto take its place once it is removed. You can add a proxy to an asset,\nor set its default, using ges_asset_set_proxy, and you can remove\nthem with ges_asset_unproxy.\n"});
