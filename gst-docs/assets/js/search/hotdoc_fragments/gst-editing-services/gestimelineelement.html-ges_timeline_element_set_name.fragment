If you call this function with name as NULL, then\nthe library should ensure that the set generated name is unique from\npreviously generated names. However, if you choose a name that\ninterferes with the naming conventions of the library, the library will\nattempt to ensure that the generated names will not conflict with the\nchosen name, which may lead to a different name being set instead, but\nthe uniqueness between generated and user-chosen names is not\nguaranteed.\nParameters:\nA GESTimelineElement\nThe name self should take\nTRUE if name or a generated name for self could be set.\nSets the name for the element.
