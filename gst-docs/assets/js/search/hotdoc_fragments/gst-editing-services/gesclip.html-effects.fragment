fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gesclip.html#effects","fragment":"Effects\nSome subclasses (#GESSourceClip and GESBaseEffectClip) may also allow\ntheir objects to have additional non-core GESBaseEffect-s elements as\nchildren. These are additional effects that are applied to the output\ndata of the core elements. They can be added to the clip using\nges_clip_add_top_effect, which will take care of adding the effect to\nthe timeline's tracks. The new effect will be placed between the clip's\ncore track elements and its other effects. As such, the newly added\neffect will be applied to any source data **before** the other existing\neffects. You can change the ordering of effects using\nges_clip_set_top_effect_index.\nTracks are selected for top effects in the same way as core children.\nIf you add a top effect to a clip before it is part of a timeline, and\nlater add the clip to a timeline, the track selection for the top\neffects will occur just after the track selection for the core\nchildren. If you add a top effect to a clip that is already part of a\ntimeline, the track selection will occur immediately. Since a top\neffect must be applied on top of a core child, if you use\nselect-tracks-for-object, you should ensure that the\nadded effects are destined for a GESTrack that already contains a core\nchild.\nIn addition, if the core child in the track is not\nactive, then neither can any of its effects be\nactive. Therefore, if a core child is made in-active,\nall of the additional effects in the same track will also become\nin-active. Similarly, if an effect is set to be active, then the core\nchild will also become active, but other effects will be left alone.\nFinally, if an active effect is added to the track of an in-active core\nchild, it will become in-active as well. Note, in contrast, setting a\ncore child to be active, or an effect to be in-active will not change\nthe other children in the same track.\n"});
