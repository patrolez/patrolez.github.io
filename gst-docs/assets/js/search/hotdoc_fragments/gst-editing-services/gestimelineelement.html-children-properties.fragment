The registered property of\nthe child can then be read and set using the\nges_timeline_element_get_child_property and\nges_timeline_element_set_child_property methods, respectively. Some\nsub-classed objects will be created with pre-registered children\nproperties; for example, to expose part of an underlying GstElement\nthat is used internally. The registered properties can be listed with\nges_timeline_element_list_children_properties.\n"});
