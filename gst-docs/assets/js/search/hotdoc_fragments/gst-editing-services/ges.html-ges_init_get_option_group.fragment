The\ngroup is set up to use standard GOption callbacks, so when using this\ngroup in combination with GOption parsing methods, all argument parsing\nand initialization is automated.\nThis function is useful if you want to integrate GES with other\nlibraries that use GOption (see g_option_context_add_group ).\nIf you use this function, you should make sure you initialise the GStreamer\nas one of the very first things in your program. That means you need to\nuse gst_init_get_option_group and add it to the option context before\nusing the ges_init_get_option_group result.\na pointer to GES's option group.\n"});
