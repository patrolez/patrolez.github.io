In addition,\nany clips may change layer.\nEach edit can be broken down into a combination of three basic edits:\nIn particular, when editing a GESClip:\nWhen editing a GESGroup:\nWhen editing a GESTrackElement, if it has a GESClip parent, this\nwill be edited instead. Otherwise it is edited in the same way as a\nGESClip.\nThe layer priority of a GESGroup is the lowest layer priority of any\nGESClip underneath it. When a group is edited to a new layer\npriority, it will shift all clips underneath it by the same amount,\nsuch that their relative layers stay the same.\nIf the GESTimeline has a snapping-distance, then snapping\nmay occur for some of the edges of the main edited element:\nThese edges may snap with either the start or end edge of any other\nGESSource in the timeline that is not also being moved by the element,\nincluding those in different layers, if they are within the\nsnapping-distance. During an edit, only up to one snap can\noccur. This will shift the edit position such that the snapped edges\nwill touch once the edit has completed.\nNote that snapping can cause an edit to fail where it would have\notherwise succeeded because it may push the edit position such that the\nedit would result in an unsupported timeline configuration. Similarly,\nsnapping can cause an edit to succeed where it would have otherwise\nfailed.\nFor example, in GES_EDIT_MODE_RIPPLE acting on GES_EDGE_NONE, the\nmain element is the MOVED toplevel of the edited element. Any source\nunder the main MOVED toplevel may have its start or end edge snapped.\nNote, these sources cannot snap with each other. The edit may also\npush other elements, but any sources under these elements cannot snap,\nnor can they be snapped with. If a snap does occur, the MOVE of the\ntoplevel and all other elements pushed by the ripple will be shifted\nby the same amount such that the snapped edges will touch.\nYou can also find more explanation about the behaviour of those modes at:\ntrim, ripple and roll\nand clip management.\nThe element is edited the normal way (default).\nIf acting on the element as a whole (#GES_EDGE_NONE), this will MOVE\nthe element by MOVING its toplevel. When acting on the start of the\nelement (#GES_EDGE_START), this will only MOVE the element, but not\nits toplevel parent. This can allow you to move a GESClip or\nGESGroup to a new start time or layer within its container group,\nwithout effecting other members of the group. When acting on the end\nof the element (#GES_EDGE_END), this will END-TRIM the element,\nleaving its toplevel unchanged.\nThe element is edited in ripple mode: moving\nitself as well as later elements, keeping their relative times. This\nedits the element the same as GES_EDIT_MODE_NORMAL. In addition, if\nacting on the element as a whole, or the start of the element, any\ntoplevel element in the same timeline (including different layers)\nwhose start time is later than the current start time of the MOVED\nelement will also be MOVED by the same shift as the edited element.\nIf acting on the end of the element, any toplevel element whose start\ntime is later than the current end time of the edited element will\nalso be MOVED by the same shift as the change in the end of the\nedited element. These additional elements will also be shifted by\nthe same shift in layers as the edited element.\nThe element is edited in roll mode: swapping its\ncontent for its neighbour's, or vis versa, in the timeline output.\nThis edits the element the same as GES_EDIT_MODE_TRIM. In addition,\nany neighbours are also TRIMMED at their opposite edge to the same\ntimeline position. When acting on the start of the element, a\nneighbour is any earlier element in the timeline whose end time\nmatches the current start time of the edited element. When acting on\nthe end of the element, a neighbour is any later element in the\ntimeline whose start time matches the current start time of the\nedited element. In addition, a neighbour have a GESSource at its\nend/start edge that shares a track with a GESSource at the start/end\nedge of the edited element. Basically, a neighbour is an element that\ncan be extended, or cut, to have its content replace, or be replaced\nby, the content of the edited element. Acting on the element as a\nwhole (#GES_EDGE_NONE) is not defined. The element can not shift\nlayers under this mode.\nThe element is edited in trim mode. When acting\non the start of the element, this will START-TRIM it. When acting on\nthe end of the element, this will END-TRIM it. Acting on the element\nas a whole (#GES_EDGE_NONE) is not defined.\nThe element is edited in slide mode (not yet\nimplemented): moving the element replacing or consuming content on\neach end. When acting on the element as a whole, this will MOVE the\nelement, and TRIM any neighbours on either side. A neighbour is\ndefined in the same way as in GES_EDIT_MODE_ROLL, but they may be on\neither side of the edited elements. Elements at the end with be\nSTART-TRIMMED to the new end position of the edited element. Elements\nat the start will be END-TRIMMED to the new start position of the\nedited element. Acting on the start or end of the element\n(#GES_EDGE_START and GES_EDGE_END) is not defined. The element can\nnot shift layers under this mode.\nWhen a single timeline element is edited within its timeline at some\nposition, using GES.TimelineElement.prototype.edit, depending on the edit\nmode, its start, duration or\nin-point will be adjusted accordingly.
