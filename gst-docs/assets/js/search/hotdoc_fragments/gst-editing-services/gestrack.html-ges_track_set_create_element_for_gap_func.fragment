A gap is a timeline\nregion where the track has no GESTrackElement sources. Therefore, you\nare likely to want the GstElement returned by the function to always\nproduce 'empty' content, defined relative to the stream type, such as\ntransparent frames for a video, or mute samples for audio.\nGESAudioTrack and GESVideoTrack objects are created with such a\nfunction already set appropriately.\nParameters:\nA GESTrack\nThe function to be used to create a source\nGstElement that can fill gaps in track\n"});
