In particular, any class that implements the\nGESExtractable interface may have some associated assets with a\ncorresponding extractable-type, from which its objects can be\nextracted using ges_asset_extract. Some examples would be\nGESClip, GESFormatter and GESTrackElement.\nAll assets that are created within GES are stored in a cache; one per\neach id and extractable-type pair. These assets can\nbe fetched, and initialized if they do not yet exist in the cache,\nusing ges_asset_request.\nThe advantage of using assets, rather than simply creating the object\ndirectly, is that the currently loaded resources can be listed with\nges_list_assets and displayed to an end user. For example, to show\nwhich media files have been loaded, and a standard list of effects. In\nfact, the GES library already creates assets for GESTransitionClip and\nGESFormatter, which you can use to list all the available transition\ntypes and supported formats.\nThe other advantage is that GESAsset implements GESMetaContainer, so\nmetadata can be set on the asset, with some subclasses automatically\ncreating this metadata on initiation.\nFor example, to display information about the supported formats, you\ncould do the following:\n"});
