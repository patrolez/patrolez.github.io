fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gesmetacontainer.html#registered-fields","fragment":"Registered Fields\nBy default, any GValue can be set for a metadata field. However, you\ncan register some fields as static, that is they only allow values of a\nspecific type to be set under them, using\nges_meta_container_register_meta or\nges_meta_container_register_static_meta. The set GESMetaFlag will\ndetermine whether the value can be changed, but even if it can be\nchanged, it must be changed to a value of the same type.\nInternally, some GES objects will be initialized with static metadata\nfields. These will correspond to some standard keys, such as\nGES_META_VOLUME.\n"});
