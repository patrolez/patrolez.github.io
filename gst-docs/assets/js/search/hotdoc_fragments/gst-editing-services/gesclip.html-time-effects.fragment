fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gesclip.html#time-effects","fragment":"Time Effects\nSome effects also change the timing of their data (see GESBaseEffect\nfor what counts as a time effect). Note that a GESBaseEffectClip will\nrefuse time effects, but a GESSource will allow them.\nWhen added to a clip, time effects may adjust the timing of other\nchildren in the same track. Similarly, when changing the order of\neffects, making them (in)-active, setting their time property values\nor removing time effects. These can cause the duration-limit\nto change in value. However, if such an operation would ever cause the\nduration to shrink such that a clip's GESSource is\ntotally overlapped in the timeline, the operation would be prevented.\nNote that the same can happen when adding non-time effects with a\nfinite max-duration.\nTherefore, when working with time effects, you should -- more so than\nusual -- not assume that setting the properties of the clip's children\nwill succeed. In particular, you should use\nges_timeline_element_set_child_property_full when setting the time\nproperties.\nIf you wish to preserve the internal duration of a source in a clip\nduring these time effect operations, you can do something like the\nfollowing.\n"});
