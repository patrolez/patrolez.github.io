Each clip may exist in\na single layer but may control several GESTrackElement-s that span\nseveral GESTrack-s. A clip will ensure that all its children share the\nsame start and duration in\ntheir tracks, which will match the start and\nduration of the clip itself. Therefore, changing\nthe timing of the clip will change the timing of the children, and a\nchange in the timing of a child will change the timing of the clip and\nsubsequently all its siblings. As such, a clip can be treated as a\nsingular object in its layer.\nFor most uses of a GESTimeline, it is often sufficient to only\ninteract with GESClip-s directly, which will take care of creating and\norganising the elements of the timeline's tracks.\n"});
