fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst-editing-services/gesgroup.html#gesgroup-page","fragment":"GESGroup\nA GESGroup controls one or more GESContainer-s (usually GESClip-s,\nbut it can also control other GESGroup-s). Its children must share\nthe same GESTimeline, but can otherwise lie in separate GESLayer-s\nand have different timings.\nTo initialise a group, you may want to use ges_container_group,\nand similarly use ges_container_ungroup to dispose of it.\nA group will maintain the relative start times of\nits children, as well as their relative layer priority.\nTherefore, if one of its children has its start\nset, all other children will have their start\nshifted by the same amount. Similarly, if one of its children moves to\na new layer, the other children will also change layers to maintain the\ndifference in their layer priorities. For example, if a child moves\nfrom a layer with priority 1 to a layer with priority 3, then\nanother child that was in a layer with priority 0 will move to the\nlayer with priority 2.\nThe start of a group refers to the earliest start\ntime of its children. If the group's start is set, all the\nchildren will be shifted equally such that the earliest start time\nwill match the set value. The duration of a group is the\ndifference between the earliest start time and latest end time of its\nchildren. If the group's duration is increased, the children\nwhose end time matches the end of the group will be extended\naccordingly. If it is decreased, then any child whose end time exceeds\nthe new end time will also have their duration decreased accordingly.\nA group may span several layers, but for methods such as\nges_timeline_element_get_layer_priority and\nges_timeline_element_edit a group is considered to have a layer\npriority that is the highest priority (numerically, the\nsmallest) of all the layers it spans.\n"});
