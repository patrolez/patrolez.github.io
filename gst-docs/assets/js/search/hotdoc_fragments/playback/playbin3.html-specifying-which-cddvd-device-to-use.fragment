fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"playback/playbin3.html#specifying-which-cddvd-device-to-use","fragment":"Specifying which CD/DVD device to use\nThe device to use for CDs/DVDs needs to be set on the source element playbin3\ncreates before it is opened. The most generic way of doing this is to connect\nto playbin3's \"source-setup\" signal, which will be emitted by playbin3 when\nit has created the source element for a particular URI. In the signal\ncallback you can check if the source element has a \"device\" property and set\nit appropriately. In some cases the device can also be set as part of the\nURI, but it depends on the elements involved if this will work or not. For\nexample, for DVD menu playback, the following syntax might work (if the\nresindvd plugin is used): dvd://[/path/to/device]\n"});
