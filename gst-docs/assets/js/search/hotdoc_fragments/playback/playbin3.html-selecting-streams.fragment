fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"playback/playbin3.html#selecting-streams","fragment":"Selecting streams\nThe recommended way to select streams (instead of the default selection) is\nto listen to GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION messages on the GstBus and send a\nGST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS on the pipeline with the selected streams. This\nprovides more information and flexibility compared to the legacy playbin\nproperty and signal-based mechanism.\nNote: The application should not assume that collections will not change\nthroughout a single file. If it wishes to modify the default selection, it\nshould always respond to new collections posted on the bus with a\nGST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS.\n"});
