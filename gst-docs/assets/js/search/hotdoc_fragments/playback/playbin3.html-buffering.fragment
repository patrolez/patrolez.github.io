fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"playback/playbin3.html#buffering","fragment":"Buffering\nPlaybin3 handles buffering automatically for the most part, but applications\nneed to handle parts of the buffering process as well. Whenever playbin3 is\nbuffering, it will post BUFFERING messages on the bus with a percentage\nvalue that shows the progress of the buffering process. Applications need\nto set playbin3 to PLAYING or PAUSED state in response to these messages.\nThey may also want to convey the buffering progress to the user in some\nway. Here is how to extract the percentage information from the message:\nNote that applications should keep/set the pipeline in the PAUSED state when\na BUFFERING message is received with a buffer percent value < 100 and set\nthe pipeline back to PLAYING state when a BUFFERING message with a value\nof 100 percent is received (if PLAYING is the desired state, that is).\n"});
