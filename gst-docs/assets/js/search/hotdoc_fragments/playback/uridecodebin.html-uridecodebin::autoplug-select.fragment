For each of\nthose factories, this signal is emitted.\nThe signal handler should return a GstAutoplugSelectResult enum\nvalue indicating what decodebin should do next.\nA value of try will try to autoplug an element from\nfactory.\nA value of expose will expose pad without plugging\nany element to it.\nA value of skip will skip factory and move to the\nnext factory.\nThe signal handler will not be invoked if any of the previously\nregistered signal handlers (if any) return a value other than\nGST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_TRY. Which also means that if you return\nGST_AUTOPLUG_SELECT_TRY from one signal handler, handlers that get\nregistered next (again, if any) can override that decision.\nParameters:\nThe uridecodebin.\nThe GstPad.\nThe GstCaps.\nA GstElementFactory to use.\na GstAutoplugSelectResult that indicates the required\noperation. The default handler will always return\ntry.\n\n\tFlags:\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRun Last\n\t\t\t\n\n"});
