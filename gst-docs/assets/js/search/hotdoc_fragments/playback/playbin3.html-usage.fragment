fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"playback/playbin3.html#usage","fragment":"Usage\nA playbin element can be created just like any other element using\ngst_element_factory_make. The file/URI to play should be set via the uri\nproperty. This must be an absolute URI, relative file paths are not allowed.\nExample URIs are file:///home/joe/movie.avi or http://www.joedoe.com/foo.ogg\nPlaybin3 is a GstPipeline. It will notify the application of everything\nthat's happening (errors, end of stream, tags found, state changes, etc.)\nby posting messages on its GstBus. The application needs to watch the\nbus.\nPlayback can be initiated by setting the element to PLAYING state using\ngst_element_set_state. Note that the state change will take place in\nthe background in a separate thread, when the function returns playback\nis probably not happening yet and any errors might not have occurred yet.\nApplications using playbin3 should ideally be written to deal with things\ncompletely asynchroneous.\nWhen playback has finished (an EOS message has been received on the bus)\nor an error has occurred (an ERROR message has been received on the bus) or\nthe user wants to play a different track, playbin3 should be set back to\nREADY or NULL state, then the uri property should be set to the\nnew location and then playbin3 be set to PLAYING state again.\nSeeking can be done using gst_element_seek_simple or gst_element_seek\non the playbin3 element. Again, the seek will not be executed\ninstantaneously, but will be done in a background thread. When the seek\ncall returns the seek will most likely still be in process. An application\nmay wait for the seek to finish (or fail) using gst_element_get_state with\n-1 as the timeout, but this will block the user interface and is not\nrecommended at all.\nApplications may query the current position and duration of the stream\nvia gst_element_query_position and gst_element_query_duration and\nsetting the format passed to GST_FORMAT_TIME. If the query was successful,\nthe duration or position will have been returned in units of nanoseconds.\n"});
