fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"playback/playbin.html#specifying-which-cddvd-device-to-use","fragment":"Specifying which CD/DVD device to use\nThe device to use for CDs/DVDs needs to be set on the source element\nplaybin creates before it is opened. The most generic way of doing this\nis to connect to playbin's \"source-setup\" (or \"notify::source\") signal,\nwhich will be emitted by playbin when it has created the source element\nfor a particular URI. In the signal callback you can check if the source\nelement has a \"device\" property and set it appropriately. In some cases\nthe device can also be set as part of the URI, but it depends on the\nelements involved if this will work or not. For example, for DVD menu\nplayback, the following syntax might work (if the resindvd plugin is used):\ndvd://[/path/to/device]\n"});
