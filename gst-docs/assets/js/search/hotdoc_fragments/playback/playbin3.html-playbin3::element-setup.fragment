This signal can be used to configure elements, e.g. to set\nproperties on decoders. This is functionally equivalent to connecting to\nthe deep-element-added signal, but more convenient.\nThis signal is usually emitted from the context of a GStreamer streaming\nthread, so might be called at the same time as code running in the main\napplication thread.\nParameters:\na playbin3\nan element that was added to the playbin hierarchy\n\n\tFlags:\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRun Last\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.10\n\t\t\n"});
