These are element messages containing\na structure named 'redirect' along with a 'new-location' field of string\ntype. The new location may be a relative or an absolute URI. Examples\nfor such redirects can be found in many quicktime movie trailers.\nNOTE: playbin will internally handle the redirect messages in the case\nthat the redirecting stream doesn't contain any tracks and thus\nneeds to report an error message on the bus.\n"});
