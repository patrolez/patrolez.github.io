If you press the mouse button somewhere on the\nvideo and release it somewhere else a green box will appear where you pressed\nthe button and a red one where you released it. (The navigationtest element\nis part of gst-plugins-good.) You can observe here that even if the images\nare scaled through hardware the pointer coordinates are converted back to the\noriginal video frame geometry so that the box can be drawn to the correct\nposition. This also handles borders correctly, limiting coordinates to the\nimage area\n"});
