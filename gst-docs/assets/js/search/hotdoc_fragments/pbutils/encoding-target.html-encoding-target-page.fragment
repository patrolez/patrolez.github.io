Those can define several GstEncodingProfiles with\ndifferent names, for example one for transcoding in full HD, another one for\nlow res, etc.. which are defined in the same encoding target.\nBasically if you want to encode a stream to send it to, say, youtube you should\nhave a Youtube encoding target defined in the \"online-service\" category.\n"});
