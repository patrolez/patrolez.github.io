Installer hook\nWhen GStreamer applications initiate plugin installation via\ngst_install_plugins_async or gst_install_plugins_sync, a\npre-defined helper application will be called.\nThe exact path of the helper application to be called is set at compile\ntime, usually by the build system based on the install prefix.\nFor a normal package build into the /usr prefix, this will usually\ndefault to /usr/libexec/gst-install-plugins-helper or\n/usr/lib/gst-install-plugins-helper.\nVendors/distros who want to support GStreamer plugin installation should\neither provide such a helper script/application or use the meson option\n-Dinstall_plugins_helper'=/path/to/installer to make GStreamer call an\ninstaller of their own directly.\nIt is strongly recommended that vendors provide a small helper\napplication as interlocutor to the real installer though, even more so\nif command line argument munging is required to transform the command\nline arguments passed by GStreamer to the helper application into\narguments that are understood by the real installer.\nThe helper application path defined at compile time can be overridden at\nruntime by setting the GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_HELPER environment\nvariable. This can be useful for testing/debugging purposes.\n"});
