The top-level profiles are commonly\nGstEncodingContainerProfile(s) (which contains a user-readable name and\ndescription along with which container format to use). These, in turn,\nreference one or more GstEncodingProfile(s) which indicate which encoding\nformat should be used on each individual streams.\nGstEncodingProfile(s) can be provided to the 'encodebin' element, which will\ntake care of selecting and setting up the required elements to produce an\noutput stream conforming to the specifications of the profile.\nThe encoding profiles do not necessarily specify which GstElement to use for\nthe various encoding and muxing steps, as they allow to specifying the format\none wishes to use.\nEncoding profiles can be created at runtime by the application or loaded from\n(and saved to) file using the GstEncodingTarget API.\n"});
