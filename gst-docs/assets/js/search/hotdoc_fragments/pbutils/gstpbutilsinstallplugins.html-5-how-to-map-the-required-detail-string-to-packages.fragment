How to map the required detail string to packages\nIt is up to the vendor to find mechanism to map required components from\nthe detail string to the actual packages/plugins to install. This could\nbe a hardcoded list of mappings, for example, or be part of the\npackaging system metadata.\nGStreamer plugin files can be introspected for this information. The\ngst-inspect utility has a special command line option that will output\ninformation similar to what is required. For example $ gst-inspect-1.0 --print-plugin-auto-install-info /path/to/libgstvorbis.so should output something along the lines ofdecoder-audio/x-vorbis,element-vorbisdecelement-vorbisencelement-vorbisparse,element-vorbistag,encoder-audio/x-vorbis`\nNote that in the encoder and decoder case the introspected caps can be\nmore complex with additional fields, e.g.\naudio/mpeg,mpegversion=(int){2,4}, so they will not always exactly\nmatch the caps wanted by the application. It is up to the installer to\ndeal with this (either by doing proper caps intersection using the\nGStreamer GstCaps API, or by only taking into account the media type).\nAnother potential source of problems are plugins such as ladspa or\nlibvisual where the list of elements depends on the installed\nladspa/libvisual plugins at the time. This is also up to the\ndistribution to handle (but usually not relevant for playback\napplications).\n"});
