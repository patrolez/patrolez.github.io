The purpose is\nto allow two decoupled pipelines to function as though they are one without\nhaving to manually shuttle buffers, events, queries, etc between the two.\nThe element queues buffers from the matching proxysink to an internal queue,\nso everything downstream is properly decoupled from the upstream pipeline.\nHowever, the queue may get filled up if the downstream pipeline does not\naccept buffers quickly enough; perhaps because it is not yet PLAYING.\n"});
