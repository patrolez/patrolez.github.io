The first dimension are the\nchannels and the second dimension are the values.\n\n\nGstClockTime timestamp: the timestamp of the buffer that triggered the message.\n\nGstClockTime stream-time: the stream time of the buffer.\n\nGstClockTime running-time: the running_time of the buffer.\n\nGstClockTime duration: the duration of the buffer.\n\nGstClockTime endtime: the end time of the buffer that triggered the message as stream time (this\nis deprecated, as it can be calculated from stream-time + duration)\nA GST_TYPE_LIST value of gfloat magnitude: the level for each frequency band in dB.\nAll values below the value of the\nthreshold property will be set to the threshold. Only present\nif the message-magnitude property is TRUE.\nA GST_TYPE_LIST of gfloat phase: The phase for each frequency band. The value is between -pi and pi. Only\npresent if the message-phase property is TRUE.\n\n"});
