As this GStreamer GL library does not preclude\nconcurrent access to the windowing system, it is strongly advised that\napplications ensure that threading support has been initialized before any\nother toolkit/library functionality is accessed.  Failure to do so could\nresult in sudden application abortion during execution.  The most notably\nexample of such a function is X11's XInitThreads().\n\nGST_GL_WINDOW influences the window system to use.  Common values are\n'x11', 'wayland', 'surfaceless', 'win32' or 'cocoa'.\nGST_GL_PLATFORM influences the OpenGL platform to use.  Common values are\n'egl', 'glx', 'wgl' or 'cgl'.\nGST_GL_API influences the OpenGL API requested by the OpenGL platform.\nCommon values are 'opengl', 'opengl3' and 'gles2'.\n\n"});
