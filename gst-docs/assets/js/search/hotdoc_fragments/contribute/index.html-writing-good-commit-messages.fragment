If the commit applies to a specific subsystem, library, plugin\nor element, prefix the message with the name of the component, for example:\nor\nor\nThis should be a summary of the change and not a description of the change.\nMeaning: don't say how you did something but what you fixed, improved or\nchanged, what the most important practical effect of the change is. Example:\ninstead of\nThe second line of the commit message should be empty.\nThe third and following lines should contain an extensive description and\nrationale of the change made: what was changed, what was broken, how did it\nget fixed, what bugs or issues does this fix? And most importantly: why was\nsomething changed.\nTrivial commits do not require a description, e.g. if you fix a memory leak\nit's usually enough to just say that you fixed a leak. Maybe mention what was\nleaked and perhaps also if it was an important leak or only happens in some\ncorner case error code path, but in any case there's no need to write a long\nexplanation why leaks are bad or why this needed fixing.\nThe important part is really what the reasoning behind the change is, since\nthat's what people want to know if they try to figure out twelve months later\nwhy a line of code does what it does.\nIf the commit is related to any particular issues in gitlab, please add a\nreference to the issue (e.g. See #123 or Fixes #123 if it fixes it the\nissue). For issues in other repositories (gst-plugins-{base,good,ugly,bad} etc.)\nplease add the full issue URL to the commit message instead (or ask for the\nissue to be moved to the monorepo gstreamer repository), e.g.\nWe do not use Signed-off by: lines in GStreamer, please create commits\nwithout such lines.\nPlease do not add references to private company-internal bug trackers or\ncode repositories in commit messages.\n"});
