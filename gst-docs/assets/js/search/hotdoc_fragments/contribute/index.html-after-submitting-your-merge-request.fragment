fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"contribute/index.html#after-submitting-your-merge-request","fragment":"After Submitting your Merge Request\nWhenever you submit a new Merge Request, add a comment to an existing issue or\nMerge Request, GitLab will send a notification e-mail to GStreamer\ndevelopers. This means that there is usually no need to advertise the fact that\nyou have done so in other forums such as on IRC or on the mailing list, unless\nyou have been asked to file an issue there, in which case it's nice to follow up\nwith the link to the issue.\nMost of all, please be patient.\nWe try to review patches as quickly as possible, but there is such a high\nvolume of issues, merge requests and feature requests that it is not always\npossible to tend to them all as quickly as we'd like. This is especially\ntrue for completely new plugins or new features.\nIf you haven't received any response at all for a while (say two weeks or so),\ndo feel free to ping developers by posting a quick follow-up comment on the\nissue or merge request.\nIf you do not get a response, this is usually not a sign of people ignoring\nthe issue, but usually just means that it's fallen through the cracks or\npeople have been busy with other things.\nMost GStreamer developers have a review workflow that's driven by e-mail or\nGitLab notifications, so posting a follow-up comment is the best way to draw\nattention to an issue or merge request.\n"});
