Since\nthe CI pipeline is triggered by Marge in this case, it will also have the\nright permissions to trigger the Cerbero sub-pipeline, which won't run for\nmonorepo pipelines triggered by external contributors.\nSidenote: Our CI pipelines don't start automatically usually, but are gated\nby a manual trigger in order not to waste CI resources. However, pipelines\nwill start running automatically if Marge triggers them which will happen\nwhen Marge rebases commits. This means that when pushing updates to a\nmerge request branch (especially if Marge touched it once already) it's\nusually a good idea to either remove the Part-of footers from the top\ncommit message, or to not be entirely on top of the target branch, so that\nMarge is forced to rebase again when being re-assigned the merge request.\nOtherwise Marge will not rebase and wait for the pipeline to complete, but\nthe pipeline won't actually run because it's not been triggered.\nIf Marge is assigned a merge request but nothing happens, it usually means\nshe's busy with another merge request in the same project and target branch.\nCheck GitLab for a list of merge requests assigned to Marge. If\nno other merge requests are being processed, you may be encountering the above\npipeline trigger problem and may have to trigger the merge request pipeline\nmanually.\n"});
