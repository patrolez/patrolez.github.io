To fork gstreamer go to\nthe repository and hit\nthe \"Fork\" button:\n\nSelect the namespace (your username), ensure that the visibility is set to\n\"Public\", and hit the \"Fork project\" button:\n\nPlease note that new gitlab accounts do not have permission to create forks by\ndefault, so you will have to first file an issue and fill in the user verification\ntemplate as mentioned above in order to get forking rights.\nThis should be a fairly quick process.\nA new repository will be created in your user namespace\n(https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer). You will be redirected\nthere automatically once the forking process is finished. The forking might\ntake a few minutes.\nOnce this is done you can add your personal fork as new remote to the gstreamer\nrepository clone you made in step 3 above with the following command (replace\n$GITLAB_USERNAME with your actual gitlab username):\nCheck with\nthat it is accessible and working.\nCommon mistakes at this point are:\na) Not setting up an SSH key\nb) Having a private fork. You can change your fork to public in the settings:\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer/edit (replace $GITLAB_USERNAME\nwith your actual gitlab username)\n"});
