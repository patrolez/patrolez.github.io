When merging fails, a notification will\nalso be generated, which helps make sure things don't fall through the\ncracks once they've been scheduled for merging.\nIt's of course fine for another developer to assign a merge request with\na Merge in X label to Marge immediately if they think it's fine to go in\nnow and don't expect further comments or review being needed by others.\n\n\nSchedule merge requests for later in the day or night, when the\nCI farm is less busy\n\n\nProvide a heads-up to other developers that you intend to merge\nsomething, whilst still allowing some time for others to review or\ncomment.\n\n\n"});
