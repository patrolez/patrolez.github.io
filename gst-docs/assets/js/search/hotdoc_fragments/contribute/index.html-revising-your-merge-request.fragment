fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"contribute/index.html#revising-your-merge-request","fragment":"Revising your merge request\nYou will often need to revise the commits in your merge request based on review\nby maintainers of the project. You do not need to open a new merge request\nto do that. You need to edit the commits in your local branch and force-push it\nto sync the branch in your namespace. That will automatically update the merge\nrequest.\nThe most common case is when you have a single commit in your branch that you\nwant to edit. To do this, first make any changes you want to do, then check the\nbranch status:\nNext, add the changes and amend your commit:\nThis will open your editor and allow you to edit the commit message if\nnecessary. Closing the editor will save the new (updated) commit.\nNext, push the changes to your remote branch:\nThis will overwrite the old commit in your remote branch with the new commit\nthat you just created. If this command completes successfully, that's it! The\nmerge request has been automatically updated.\nIf the command fails, that means that there were changes in the remote\nbranch that you hadn't pulled into your branch before amending your commit.\nThis can happen if, for example, someone uses the \"Rebase\" button on your merge\nrequest to rebase the commit(s) on top of the latest changes in the main\nbranch.\nIn that case you need to resync the two branches. This usually requires you to\nunderstand git rebase, which is beyond the scope of this document. There's\ntutorials you can find online, such as git-rebase.io\nIn the simplest case, you might be able to get away with just doing a git pull --rebase.\n"});
