The only exception here are changes that do not apply\nto the main branch anymore.\nYou do not need to create backport merge requests against stable branches.\nBackport merge requests for stable branches will be created automatically\nbased on labels on main branch merge requests.\nExisting merge request against the main branch, including merged ones,\nthat should be considered for backporting in the future should be labeled with\nthe Needs backport label and the label for the target stable branch\n(e.g. 1.18). All merge requests with the Needs backport\nlabel will be regularly considered for backporting by GStreamer developers.\nChanges that add API or change existing API will usually not be considered\nfor backporting.\nIn case patches don't apply cleanly to the target stable branch, draft WIP\nmerge requests will be created by the above-mentioned scripts. If that happens\ndevelopers will have to backport the desired commits and resolve any cherry-pick\nconflicts manually. The result should then be pushed into the existing branch\nfor the WIP backport merge request. Any GStreamer developer should be able\nto do this, and help in this area is always welcome. Please resolve the WIP/Draft\nstatus once all the relevant commits have been backported and assign the\nmerge request to the merge bot for merging.\nThere is also a Maybe backport label which can be added\nif you're not sure if commits should be backported or not, or you want to\nrevisit it later once the changes in question have seen some testing in the\ndevelopment branch. If you tag a merge request with Maybe backport it's\nusually useful to add a comment about why it's being tagged only as a maybe.\nThat will make it easier for others to evaluate whether it should be backported\nor not later.\n"});
