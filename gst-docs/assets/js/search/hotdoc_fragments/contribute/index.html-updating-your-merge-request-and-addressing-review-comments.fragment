These will usually each start\na new \"Discussion\" which is basically a thread for each comment.\nWhen you believe that you have addressed the issue raised in a discussion,\neither by updating the code or answering the questions raised, you should\n\"Resolve the Discussion\" using the button, ideally also leaving a comment\nsaying so (e.g. \"done\", \"fixed\", \"updated\", \"no longer needed\" or such). The\ncomment makes sure a notification e-mail is generated, which makes it easier\nfor GStreamer developers to keep track of what's happening.\nAt the top of each merge request in GitLab is a tracker with the number of\nunresolved discussions. This way it's easy for maintainers (and yourself)\nto see what's left to do and if there are any open questions/issues.\nWhenever you have made changes to your patches locally you can just\ngit push -f your-personal-gitlab-fork your-branch to your personal fork.\nGitLab will then pick up the changes automatically. You do not need to submit\na new Merge Request whenever you make changes to an already-submitted patchset,\nand in fact you shouldn't do that because it means all the previous discussion\ncontext is lost and it's also not easy for reviewers to see what changed.\nJust force-update your existing branch.\nYou do not need to add individial \"fixup commits\" to your branch when you address\nissues raised. Instead just fix up the original commit(s) directly using\ngit rebase etc. GitLab is able to track and show changes made between\ndifferent revisions of a merge request branch, so just keep the branch always\nto the \"latest clean version\". See the Rewriting History\nsection of the Pro Git book for more details.\nGStreamer maintainers will typically receive e-mail notifications when you add\na comment and when all oustanding discussions have been resolved. They may or\nmay not receive e-mail notifications when you update the commits in your branch.\n"});
