fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tag/gsttagdemux.html#gsttagdemux-page","fragment":"GstTagDemux\nProvides a base class for demuxing tags at the beginning or end of a\nstream and handles things like typefinding, querying, seeking, and\ndifferent modes of operation (chain-based, pull_range-based, and providing\ndownstream elements with random access if upstream supports that). The tag\nis stripped from the output, and all offsets are adjusted for the tag\nsizes, so that to the downstream element the stream will appear as if\nthere was no tag at all. Also, once the tag has been parsed, GstTagDemux\nwill try to determine the media type of the resulting stream and add a\nsource pad with the appropriate caps in order to facilitate auto-plugging.\n"});
