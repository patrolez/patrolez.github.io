Sometimes there is also an\n'image type' to indicate what kind of image this is (e.g. front cover,\nback cover, artist, etc.). The image data may also be an URI to the image\nrather than the image itself.\nIn GStreamer, image tags are GstSamples containing the raw image\ndata, with the sample caps describing the content type of the image\n(e.g. image/jpeg, image/png, text/uri-list). The sample info may contain\nan additional 'image-type' field of GstTagImageType to describe\nthe type of image (front cover, back cover etc.). GST_TAG_PREVIEW_IMAGE\ntags should not carry an image type, their type is already indicated via\nthe special tag name.\nThis function will do various checks and typefind the encoded image\ndata (we can't trust the declared mime type).\nParameters:\nthe (encoded) image\nthe length of the encoded image data at image_data\ntype of the image, or GST_TAG_IMAGE_TYPE_UNDEFINED.
