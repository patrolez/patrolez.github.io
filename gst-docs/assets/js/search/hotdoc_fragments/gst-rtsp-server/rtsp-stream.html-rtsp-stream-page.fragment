It\nis created from a payloader element and a source pad that produce the RTP\npackets for the stream.\nWith gst_rtsp_stream_join_bin the streaming elements are added to the bin\nand rtpbin. gst_rtsp_stream_leave_bin removes the elements again.\nThe GstRTSPStream will use the configured addresspool, as set with\ngst_rtsp_stream_set_address_pool, to allocate multicast addresses for the\nstream. With gst_rtsp_stream_get_multicast_address you can get the\nconfigured address.\nWith gst_rtsp_stream_get_server_port () you can get the port that the server\nwill use to receive RTCP. This is the part that the clients will use to send\nRTCP to.\nWith gst_rtsp_stream_add_transport destinations can be added where the\nstream should be sent to. Use gst_rtsp_stream_remove_transport to remove\nthe destination again.\nEach GstRTSPStreamTransport spawns one queue that will serve as a backlog of a\ncontrollable maximum size when the reflux from the TCP connection's backpressure\nstarts spilling all over.\nUnlike the backlog in rtspconnection, which we have decided should only contain\nat most one RTP and one RTCP data message in order to allow control messages to\ngo through unobstructed, this backlog only consists of data messages, allowing\nus to fill it up without concern.\nWhen multiple TCP transports exist, for example in the context of a shared media,\nwe only pop samples from our appsinks when at least one of the transports doesn't\nexperience back pressure: this allows us to pace our sample popping to the speed\nof the fastest client.\nWhen a sample is popped, it is either sent directly on transports that don't\nexperience backpressure, or queued on the transport's backlog otherwise. Samples\nare then popped from that backlog when the transport reports it has sent the message.\nOnce the backlog reaches an overly large duration, the transport is dropped as\nthe client was deemed too slow.\n"});
