With gst_rtsp_thread_pool_get_max_threads a maximum\nnumber of threads can be set after which the pool will start to reuse the\nsame thread for multiple clients.\nThreads of type GST_RTSP_THREAD_TYPE_MEDIA will be used to perform the state\nchanges of the media pipelines and handle its bus messages.\ngst_rtsp_thread_pool_get_thread can be used to create a GstRTSPThread\nobject of the right type. The thread object contains a mainloop and context\nthat run in a seperate thread and can be used to attached sources to.\ngst_rtsp_thread_reuse can be used to reuse a thread for multiple purposes.\nIf all gst_rtsp_thread_reuse calls are matched with a\ngst_rtsp_thread_stop call, the mainloop will be quit and the thread will\nstop.\nTo configure the threads, a subclass of this object should be made and the\nvirtual methods should be overriden to implement the desired functionality.\nLast reviewed on 2013-07-11 (1.0.0)\n"});
