It is usually manages by a GstRTSPSessionMedia object.\nWith gst_rtsp_stream_transport_set_callbacks, callbacks can be configured\nto handle the RTP and RTCP packets from the stream, for example when they\nneed to be sent over TCP.\nWith gst_rtsp_stream_transport_set_active the transports are added and\nremoved from the stream.\nA GstRTSPStream will call gst_rtsp_stream_transport_keep_alive when RTCP\nis received from the client. It will also call\ngst_rtsp_stream_transport_set_timed_out when a receiver has timed out.\nA GstRTSPClient will call gst_rtsp_stream_transport_message_sent when it\nhas sent a data message for the transport.\nLast reviewed on 2013-07-16 (1.0.0)\n"});
