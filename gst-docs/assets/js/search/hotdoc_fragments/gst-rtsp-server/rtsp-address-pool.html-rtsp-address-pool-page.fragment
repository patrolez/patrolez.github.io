It is used to allocate server ports and server multicast addresses\nbut also to reserve client provided destination addresses.\nA range of addresses can be added with gst_rtsp_address_pool_add_range.\nBoth multicast and unicast addresses can be added.\nWith gst_rtsp_address_pool_acquire_address an unused address and port range\ncan be acquired from the pool. With gst_rtsp_address_pool_reserve_address a\nspecific address can be retrieved. Both methods return a boxed\nGstRTSPAddress that should be freed with gst_rtsp_address_free after\nusage, which brings the address back into the pool.\nLast reviewed on 2013-07-16 (1.0.0)\n"});
