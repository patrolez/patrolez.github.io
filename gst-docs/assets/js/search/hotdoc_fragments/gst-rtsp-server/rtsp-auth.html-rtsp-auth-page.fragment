The default implementation has some\nreasonable checks but subclasses can implement custom security policies.\nA new auth object is made with gst_rtsp_auth_new. It is usually configured\non the GstRTSPServer object.\nThe RTSP server will call gst_rtsp_auth_check with a string describing the\ncheck to perform. The possible checks are prefixed with\nGST_RTSP_AUTH_CHECK_*. Depending on the check, the default implementation\nwill use the current GstRTSPToken, GstRTSPContext and\nGstRTSPPermissions on the object to check if an operation is allowed.\nThe default GstRTSPAuth object has support for basic authentication. With\ngst_rtsp_auth_add_basic you can add a basic authentication string together\nwith the GstRTSPToken that will become active when successfully\nauthenticated.\nWhen a TLS certificate has been set with gst_rtsp_auth_set_tls_certificate,\nthe default auth object will require the client to connect with a TLS\nconnection.\nLast reviewed on 2013-07-16 (1.0.0)\n"});
