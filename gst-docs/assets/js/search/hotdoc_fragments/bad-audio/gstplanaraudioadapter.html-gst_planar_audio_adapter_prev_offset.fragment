When\ndistance is given, the amount of samples between the offset and the current\nposition is returned.\nThe offset is reset to GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE and the distance is set to 0\nwhen the adapter is first created or when it is cleared. This also means that\nbefore the first sample with an offset is removed from the adapter, the\noffset and distance returned are GST_BUFFER_OFFSET_NONE and 0 respectively.\nParameters:\na GstPlanarAudioAdapter\npointer to a location for distance, or NULL\nThe previous seen offset.\nGet the offset that was before the current sample in the adapter.
