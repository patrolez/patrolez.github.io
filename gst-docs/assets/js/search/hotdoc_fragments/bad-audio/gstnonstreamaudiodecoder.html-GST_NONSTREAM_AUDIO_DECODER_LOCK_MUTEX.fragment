fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"bad-audio/gstnonstreamaudiodecoder.html#GST_NONSTREAM_AUDIO_DECODER_LOCK_MUTEX","fragment":"\n\tGST_NONSTREAM_AUDIO_DECODER_LOCK_MUTEX\n\nLocks the decoder mutex.\nInternally, the mutex is locked before one of the class vfuncs are\ncalled, when position and duration queries are handled, and when\nproperties are set/retrieved.\nDerived classes should call lock during decoder related modifications\n(for example, setting/clearing filter banks), when at the same time\naudio might get decoded. An example are configuration changes that\nhappen when properties are set. Properties might be set from another\nthread, so while the derived decoder is reconfigured, the mutex\nshould be locked.\nParameters:\nbase nonstream audio codec instance\n"});
