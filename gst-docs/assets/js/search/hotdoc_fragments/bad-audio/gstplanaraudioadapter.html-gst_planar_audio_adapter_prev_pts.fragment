When\ndistance is given, the amount of samples between the pts and the current\nposition is returned.\nThe pts is reset to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and the distance is set to 0 when\nthe adapter is first created or when it is cleared. This also means that before\nthe first sample with a pts is removed from the adapter, the pts\nand distance returned are GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and 0 respectively.\nParameters:\na GstPlanarAudioAdapter\npointer to location for distance, or NULL\nThe previously seen pts.\nGet the pts that was before the current sample in the adapter.
