When\ndistance is given, the amount of bytes between the dts and the current\nposition is returned.\nThe dts is reset to GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and the distance is set to 0 when\nthe adapter is first created or when it is cleared. This also means that\nbefore the first sample with a dts is removed from the adapter, the dts\nand distance returned are GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE and 0 respectively.\nParameters:\na GstPlanarAudioAdapter\npointer to location for distance, or NULL\nThe previously seen dts.\nGet the dts that was before the current sample in the adapter.
