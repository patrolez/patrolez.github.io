This signal will\nbe emitted from the streaming thread so applications should be prepared\nfor that.\nIn this callback, gstmultifdsink has removed all the information\nassociated with fd and it is therefore not possible to call get-stats\nwith fd. It is however safe to close() and reuse fd in the callback.\nParameters:\nthe multifdsink element that emitted this signal\nthe file descriptor that was removed from multifdsink\n\n\tFlags:\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRun Last\n\t\t\t\n\n"});
