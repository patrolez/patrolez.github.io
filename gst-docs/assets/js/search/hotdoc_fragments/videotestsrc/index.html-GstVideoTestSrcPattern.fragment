If the checkerboard\npattern is still visible after conversion, this indicates a faulty\nconversion.  Image manipulation, such as adjusting contrast or\nbrightness, can also cause the pattern to be visible.\nThe Zone Plate pattern is based on BBC R&D Report 1978/23, and can\nbe used to test spatial frequency response of a system.  This\npattern generator is controlled by the xoffset and yoffset parameters\nand also by all the parameters starting with 'k'.  The default\nparameters produce a grey pattern.  Try 'videotestsrc\npattern=zone-plate kx2=20 ky2=20 kt=1' to produce something\ninteresting.\n"});
