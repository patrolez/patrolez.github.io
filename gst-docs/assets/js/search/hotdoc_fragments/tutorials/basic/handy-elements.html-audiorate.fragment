fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/basic/handy-elements.html#audiorate","fragment":"audiorate\nThis element takes an incoming stream of time-stamped raw audio frames\nand produces a perfect stream by inserting or dropping samples as\nneeded. It does not allow the sample rate to be changed\nas videorate does, it just fills gaps and removes overlapped samples\nso the output stream is continuous and “clean”.\nIt is useful in situations where the timestamps are going to be lost\n(when storing into certain file formats, for example) and the receiver\nwill require all samples to be present. It is cumbersome to exemplify\nthis, so no example is given.\n\nMost of the time, audiorate is not what you want.\n"});
