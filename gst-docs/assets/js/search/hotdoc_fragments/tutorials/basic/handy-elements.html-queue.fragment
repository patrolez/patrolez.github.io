Basically, a queue performs two tasks:\nAdditionally, queue triggers signals when it is about to become empty\nor full (according to some configurable thresholds), and can be\ninstructed to drop buffers instead of blocking when it is full.\nAs a rule of thumb, prefer the simpler queue element\nover queue2 whenever network buffering is not a concern to you.\nSee Basic tutorial 7: Multithreading and Pad Availability\nfor an example.\n\nData is queued until a selected limit is reached. Any attempt to\npush more buffers into the queue blocks the pushing thread until\nmore space becomes available.\nThe queue creates a new thread on the source Pad to decouple the\nprocessing on sink and source Pads.\n\n"});
