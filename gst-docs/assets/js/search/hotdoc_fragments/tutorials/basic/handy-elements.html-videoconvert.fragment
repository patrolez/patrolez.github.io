fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/basic/handy-elements.html#videoconvert","fragment":"videoconvert\nThis element converts from one color space (e.g. RGB) to another one\n(e.g. YUV). It can also convert between different YUV formats (e.g.\nI420, NV12, YUY2 …) or RGB format arrangements (e.g. RGBA, ARGB, BGRA…).\nThis is normally your first choice when solving negotiation problems.\nWhen not needed, because its upstream and downstream elements can\nalready understand each other, it acts in pass-through mode having\nminimal impact on the performance.\nAs a rule of thumb, always use videoconvert whenever you use\nelements whose Caps are unknown at design time, like autovideosink, or\nthat can vary depending on external factors, like decoding a\nuser-provided file.\n"});
