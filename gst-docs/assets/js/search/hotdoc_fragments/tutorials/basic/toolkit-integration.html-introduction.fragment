A minimum\nknowledge of GTK+ will help understand this\ntutorial.\nThe main point is telling GStreamer to output the video to a window of\nour choice.\nA common issue is that GUI toolkits usually only allow manipulation of\nthe graphical “widgets” through the main (or application) thread,\nwhereas GStreamer usually spawns multiple threads to take care of\ndifferent tasks. Calling GTK+ functions from\nwithin callbacks will usually fail, because callbacks execute in the\ncalling thread, which does not need to be the main thread. This problem\ncan be solved by posting a message on the GStreamer bus in the callback:\nThe messages will be received by the main thread which will then react\naccordingly.\nFinally, so far we have registered a handle_message function that got\ncalled every time a message appeared on the bus, which forced us to\nparse every message to see if it was of interest to us. In this tutorial\na different method is used that registers a callback for each kind of\nmessage, so there is less parsing and less code overall.\n"});
