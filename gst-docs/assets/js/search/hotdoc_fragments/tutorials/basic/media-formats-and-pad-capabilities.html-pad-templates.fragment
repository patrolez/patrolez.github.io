Templates are useful to create several\nsimilar Pads, and also allow early refusal of connections between\nelements: If the Capabilities of their Pad Templates do not have a\ncommon subset (their intersection is empty), there is no need to\nnegotiate further.\nPad Templates can be viewed as the first step in the negotiation\nprocess. As the process evolves, actual Pads are instantiated and their\nCapabilities refined until they are fixed (or negotiation fails).\n"});
