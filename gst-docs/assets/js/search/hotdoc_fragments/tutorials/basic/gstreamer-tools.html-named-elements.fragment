Names allow linking to\nelements created previously in the description, and are indispensable to\nuse elements with multiple output pads, like demuxers or tees, for\nexample.\nNamed elements are referred to using their name followed by a\ndot.\nYou should see two video windows, showing the same sample video pattern.\nIf you see only one, try to move it, since it is probably on top of the\nsecond window.\nThis example instantiates a videotestsrc, linked to a\nvideoconvert, linked to a tee (Remember from Basic tutorial 7: Multithreading and Pad Availability that\na tee copies to each of its output pads everything coming through its\ninput pad). The tee is named simply ‘t’ (using the name property)\nand then linked to a queue and an autovideosink. The same tee is\nreferred to using ‘t.’ (mind the dot) and then linked to a second\nqueue and a second autovideosink.\nTo learn why the queues are necessary read Basic tutorial 7: Multithreading and Pad Availability.\n"});
