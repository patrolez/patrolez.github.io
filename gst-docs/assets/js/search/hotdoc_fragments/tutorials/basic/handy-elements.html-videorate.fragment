The\ncorrection is performed by dropping and duplicating frames, no fancy\nalgorithm is used to interpolate frames.\nThis is useful to allow elements requiring different frame rates to\nlink. As with the other adapters, if it is not needed (because there is\na frame rate on which both Pads can agree), it acts in pass-through mode\nand does not impact performance.\nIt is therefore a good idea to always use it whenever the actual frame\nrate is unknown at design time, just in\ncase.\n"});
