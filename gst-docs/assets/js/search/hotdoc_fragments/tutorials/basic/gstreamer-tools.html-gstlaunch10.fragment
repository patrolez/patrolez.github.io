It allows you to quickly check if a\ngiven pipeline works, before going through the actual implementation\nusing GStreamer API calls.\nBear in mind that it can only create simple pipelines. In particular, it\ncan only simulate the interaction of the pipeline with the application\nup to a certain level. In any case, it is extremely handy to test\npipelines quickly, and is used by GStreamer developers around the world\non a daily basis.\nPlease note that gst-launch-1.0 is primarily a debugging tool for\ndevelopers. You should not build applications on top of it. Instead, use\nthe gst_parse_launch() function of the GStreamer API as an easy way to\nconstruct pipelines from pipeline descriptions.\nAlthough the rules to construct pipeline descriptions are very simple,\nthe concatenation of multiple elements can quickly make such\ndescriptions resemble black magic. Fear not, for everyone learns the\ngst-launch-1.0 syntax, eventually.\nThe command line for gst-launch-1.0 consists of a list of options followed\nby a PIPELINE-DESCRIPTION. Some simplified instructions are given next,\nsee the complete documentation at the reference page\nfor gst-launch-1.0.\n"});
