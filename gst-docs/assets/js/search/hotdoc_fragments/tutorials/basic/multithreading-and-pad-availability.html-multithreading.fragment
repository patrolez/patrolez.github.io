This means that, internally, it\ncreates and destroys threads as it needs them, for example, to decouple\nstreaming from the application thread. Moreover, plugins are also free\nto create threads for their own processing, for example, a video decoder\ncould create 4 threads to take full advantage of a CPU with 4 cores.\nOn top of this, when building the pipeline an application can specify\nexplicitly that a branch (a part of the pipeline) runs on a different\nthread (for example, to have the audio and video decoders executing\nsimultaneously).\nThis is accomplished using the queue element, which works as follows.\nThe sink pad just enqueues data and returns control. On a different\nthread, data is dequeued and pushed downstream. This element is also\nused for buffering, as seen later in the streaming tutorials. The size\nof the queue can be controlled through properties.\n"});
