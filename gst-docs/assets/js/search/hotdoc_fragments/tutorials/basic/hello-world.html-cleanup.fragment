Setting the pipeline to the NULL state will\nmake sure it frees any resources it has allocated (More about states in\nBasic tutorial 3: Dynamic pipelines). Finally, unreferencing the\npipeline will destroy it, and all its contents.\nThe pipeline state should always be set back to GST_STATE_NULL before\nquitting.\n"});
