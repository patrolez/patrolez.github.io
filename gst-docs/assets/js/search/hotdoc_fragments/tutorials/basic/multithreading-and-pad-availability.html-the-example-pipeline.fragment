One branch then sends the signal to\nthe audio card, and the other renders a video of the waveform and sends\nit to the screen.\nAs seen in the picture, queues create a new thread, so this pipeline\nruns in 3 threads. Pipelines with more than one sink usually need to be\nmultithreaded, because, to be synchronized, sinks usually block\nexecution until all other sinks are ready, and they cannot get ready if\nthere is only one thread, being blocked by the first sink.\n"});
