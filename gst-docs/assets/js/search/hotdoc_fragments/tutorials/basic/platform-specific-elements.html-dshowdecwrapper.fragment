They are different enough, though, so\nthat their pipelines cannot be interconnected. However, through this\nelement, GStreamer can benefit from the decoding elements present in\nDirect Show. dshowdecwrapper wraps multiple Direct Show decoders so\nthey can be embedded in a GStreamer pipeline. Use the gst-inspect-1.0 tool\n(see Basic tutorial 10: GStreamer tools) to see the\navailable decoders.\n"});
