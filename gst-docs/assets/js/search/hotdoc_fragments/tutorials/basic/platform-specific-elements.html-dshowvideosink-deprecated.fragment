It can use different\nrendering back-ends, like\nEVR,\nVMR9\nor\nVMR7,\nEVR only being available on Windows Vista or more recent. It supports\nrescaling and filtering of the scaled image to alleviate aliasing. It\nimplements the VideoOverlay interface, so the video window can be\nre-parented (embedded inside other windows).
