Use\nvertigotv for a nice effect. You will need to create it, add it to the\npipeline, and link it with the other elements.\nDepending on your platform and available plugins, you might get a\n“negotiation” error, because the sink does not understand what the\nfilter is producing (more about negotiation in Basic tutorial 6: Media\nformats and Pad\nCapabilities).\nIn this case, try to add an element called videoconvert after the\nfilter (this is, build a pipeline of 4 elements. More on\nvideoconvert in Basic tutorial 14: Handy\nelements).\n"});
