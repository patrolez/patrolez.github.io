In this example we ask the pipeline if seeking is\nallowed (some sources, like live streams, do not allow seeking). If it\nis allowed, then, once the movie has been running for ten seconds, we\nskip to a different position using a seek.\nIn the previous tutorials, once we had the pipeline setup and running,\nour main function just sat and waited to receive an ERROR or an EOS\nthrough the bus. Here, we modify this function to periodically wake up\nand query the pipeline for the stream position, so we can print it on\nthe screen. This is similar to what a media player would do, updating the\nuser Interface on a periodic basis.\nFinally, the stream duration is queried and updated whenever it changes.\n"});
