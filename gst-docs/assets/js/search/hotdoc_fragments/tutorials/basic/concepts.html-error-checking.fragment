Changing states is a delicate process and a few more\ndetails are given in Basic tutorial 3: Dynamic\npipelines.\ngst_bus_timed_pop_filtered() waits for execution to end and returns\nwith a GstMessage which we previously ignored. We\nasked gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered() to return when GStreamer\nencountered either an error condition or an EOS, so we need to check\nwhich one happened, and print a message on screen (Your application will\nprobably want to undertake more complex actions).\nGstMessage is a very versatile structure which can deliver virtually\nany kind of information. Fortunately, GStreamer provides a series of\nparsing functions for each kind of message.\nIn this case, once we know the message contains an error (by using the\nGST_MESSAGE_TYPE() macro), we can use\ngst_message_parse_error() which returns a GLib GError error\nstructure and a string useful for debugging. Examine the code to see how\nthese are used and freed afterward.\n"});
