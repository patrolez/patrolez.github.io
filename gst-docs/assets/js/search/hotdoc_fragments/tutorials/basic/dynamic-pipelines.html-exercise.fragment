Prove that you have achieved its mastery by\ninstantiating an autovideosink (probably with an videoconvert in\nfront) and link it to the demuxer when the right pad appears. Hint: You\nare already printing on screen the type of the video pads.\nYou should now see (and hear) the same movie as in Basic tutorial 1:\nHello world!. In\nthat tutorial you used playbin, which is a handy element that\nautomatically takes care of all the demuxing and pad linking for you.\nMost of the Playback tutorials are devoted\nto playbin.\n"});
