By default the element tries to\nnegotiate to the same size on the source and sink Pads so that no\nscaling is needed. It is therefore safe to insert this element in a\npipeline to get more robust behavior without any cost if no scaling is\nneeded.\nThis element supports a wide range of color spaces including various YUV\nand RGB formats and is therefore generally able to operate anywhere in a\npipeline.\nIf the video is to be output to a window whose size is controlled by the\nuser, it is a good idea to use a videoscale element, since not all\nvideo sinks are capable of performing scaling\noperations.\n"});
