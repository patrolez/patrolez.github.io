The media is fetched from the Internet, so the window might take a few seconds to appear, depending on your connection speed. The Window has some GTK+ buttons to Pause, Stop and Play the movie, and a slider to show the current position of the stream, which can be dragged to change it. Also, information about the stream is shown on a column at the right edge of the window.\nBear in mind that there is no latency management (buffering), so on slow connections, the movie might stop after a few seconds. See how Basic tutorial 12: Streaming solves this issue.\nRequired libraries: gtk+-3.0 gstreamer-1.0\n"});
