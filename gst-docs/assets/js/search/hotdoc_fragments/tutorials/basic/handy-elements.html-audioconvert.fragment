fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/basic/handy-elements.html#audioconvert","fragment":"audioconvert\nThis element converts raw audio buffers between various possible\nformats. It supports integer to float conversion, width/depth\nconversion, signedness and endianness conversion and channel\ntransformations.\nLike videoconvert does for video, you use this to solve\nnegotiation problems with audio, and it is generally safe to use it\nliberally, since this element does nothing if it is not needed.\n"});
