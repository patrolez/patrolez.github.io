fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/basic/handy-elements.html#multiqueue","fragment":"multiqueue\nThis element provides queues for multiple streams simultaneously, and\neases their management, by allowing some queues to grow if no data is\nbeing received on other streams, or by allowing some queues to drop data\nif they are not connected to anything (instead of returning an error, as\na simpler queue would do). Additionally, it synchronizes the different\nstreams, ensuring that none of them goes too far ahead of the others.\nThis is an advanced element. It is found inside decodebin, but you\nwill rarely need to instantiate it yourself in a normal playback\napplication.\n"});
