fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/basic/concepts.html#pipeline-creation","fragment":"Pipeline creation\nAll elements in GStreamer must typically be contained inside a pipeline\nbefore they can be used, because it takes care of some clocking and\nmessaging functions. We create the pipeline with gst_pipeline_new().\nA pipeline is a particular type of bin, which is the element used to\ncontain other elements. Therefore all methods which apply to bins also\napply to pipelines.\nIn our case, we call gst_bin_add_many() to add the\nelements to the pipeline (mind the cast). This function accepts a list\nof elements to be added, ending with NULL. Individual elements can be\nadded with gst_bin_add().\nIn our case, we call gst_bin_add() to add elements to the pipeline.\nThe function accepts any number of Gst Elements as its arguments\nThese elements, however, are not linked with each other yet. For this,\nwe need to use gst_element_link(). Its first parameter is the source,\nand the second one the destination. The order counts, because links must\nbe established following the data flow (this is, from source elements to\nsink elements). Keep in mind that only elements residing in the same bin\ncan be linked together, so remember to add them to the pipeline before\ntrying to link them!\n"});
