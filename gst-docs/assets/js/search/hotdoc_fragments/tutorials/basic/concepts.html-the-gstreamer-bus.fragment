It is the object responsible for delivering to the application\nthe GstMessages generated by the elements, in order and to the\napplication thread. This last point is important, because the actual\nstreaming of media is done in another thread than the application.\nMessages can be extracted from the bus synchronously with\ngst_bus_timed_pop_filtered() and its siblings, or asynchronously,\nusing signals (shown in the next tutorial). Your application should\nalways keep an eye on the bus to be notified of errors and other\nplayback-related issues.\nThe rest of the code is the cleanup sequence, which is the same as\nin Basic tutorial 1: Hello\nworld!.\n"});
