Go ahead and type in the following\ncommand:\nYou should see a windows with an animated video pattern. Use CTRL+C on\nthe terminal to stop the program.\nThis instantiates a new element of type videotestsrc (an element which\ngenerates a sample video pattern), an videoconvert (an element\nwhich does raw video format conversion, making sure other elements can\nunderstand each other), and an autovideosink (a window to which video\nis rendered). Then, GStreamer tries to link the output of each element\nto the input of the element appearing on its right in the description.\nIf more than one input or output Pad is available, the Pad Caps are used\nto find two compatible Pads.\n"});
