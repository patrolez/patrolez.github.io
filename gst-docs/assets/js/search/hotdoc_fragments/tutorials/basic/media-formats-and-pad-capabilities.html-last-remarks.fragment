Therefore, the shown caps\ncan vary from platform to platform, or even from one execution to the\nnext (even though this case is rare).\nThis tutorial instantiates two elements (this time, through their\nfactories), shows their Pad Templates, links them and sets the pipeline\nto play. On each state change, the Capabilities of the sink element's\nPad are shown, so you can observe how the negotiation proceeds until the\nPad Caps are fixed.\n"});
