Basically,\nGStreamer takes care of media playback while the GUI toolkit handles\nuser interaction. The most interesting parts are those in which both\nlibraries have to interact: Instructing GStreamer to output video to a\nGTK+ window and forwarding user actions to GStreamer.\nIn particular, you will learn:\nHow to tell GStreamer to output video to a particular window\n(instead of creating its own window).\nHow to continuously refresh the GUI with information from GStreamer.\nHow to update the GUI from the multiple threads of GStreamer, an\noperation forbidden on most GUI toolkits.\nA mechanism to subscribe only to the messages you are interested in,\ninstead of being notified of all of them.\n\n\nHow to tell GStreamer to output video to a particular window\n(instead of creating its own window).\n\n\nHow to continuously refresh the GUI with information from GStreamer.\n\n\nHow to update the GUI from the multiple threads of GStreamer, an\noperation forbidden on most GUI toolkits.\n\n\nA mechanism to subscribe only to the messages you are interested in,\ninstead of being notified of all of them.\n\n\n"});
