It can work in synchronous or asynchronous\nmodes.\nIn synchronous mode, there is only a single function to call,\ngst_discoverer_discover_uri(), which blocks until the information is\nready. Due to this blocking, it is usually less interesting for\nGUI-based applications and the asynchronous mode is used, as described\nin this tutorial.\nThe recovered information includes codec descriptions, stream topology\n(number of streams and sub-streams) and available metadata (like the\naudio language).\nAs an example, this is the result\nof discovering https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/media/sintel_trailer-480p.webm\nThe following code tries to discover the URI provided through the\ncommand line, and outputs the retrieved information (If no URI is\nprovided it uses a default one).\nThis is a simplified version of what the gst-discoverer-1.0 tool does\n(Basic tutorial 10: GStreamer tools), which is\nan application that only displays data, but does not perform any\nplayback.\n"});
