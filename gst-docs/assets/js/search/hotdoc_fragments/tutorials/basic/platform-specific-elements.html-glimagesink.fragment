It supports rescaling\nand filtering of the scaled image to alleviate aliasing. It implements\nthe VideoOverlay interface, so the video window can be re-parented\n(embedded inside other windows). This is the video sink recommended on\nmost platforms except for Windows (On Windows, d3d11videosink is recommended).\nIn particular, on Android and iOS, it is the only\navailable video sink. It can be decomposed into\nglupload ! glcolorconvert ! glimagesinkelement to insert further OpenGL\nhardware accelerated processing into the pipeline.\n"});
