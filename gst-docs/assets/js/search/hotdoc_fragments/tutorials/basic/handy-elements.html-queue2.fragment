fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/basic/handy-elements.html#queue2","fragment":"queue2\nThis element is not an evolution of queue. It has the same design\ngoals but follows a different implementation approach, which results in\ndifferent features. Unfortunately, it is often not easy to tell which\nqueue is the best choice.\nqueue2 performs the two tasks listed above for queue, and,\nadditionally, is able to store the received data (or part of it) on a\ndisk file, for later retrieval. It also replaces the signals with the\nmore general and convenient buffering messages described in\nBasic tutorial 12: Streaming.\nAs a rule of thumb, prefer queue2 over queue whenever network\nbuffering is a concern to you. See Basic tutorial 12: Streaming\nfor an example (queue2 is hidden inside playbin).\n"});
