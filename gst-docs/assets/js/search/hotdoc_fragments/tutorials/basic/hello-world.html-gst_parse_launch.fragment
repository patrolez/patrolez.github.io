Media\ntravels from the “source” elements (the producers), down to the “sink”\nelements (the consumers), passing through a series of intermediate\nelements performing all kinds of tasks. The set of all the\ninterconnected elements is called a “pipeline”.\nIn GStreamer you usually build the pipeline by manually assembling the\nindividual elements, but, when the pipeline is easy enough, and you do\nnot need any advanced features, you can take the shortcut:\ngst_parse_launch().\nThis function takes a textual representation of a pipeline and turns it\ninto an actual pipeline, which is very handy. In fact, this function is\nso handy there is a tool built completely around it which you will get\nvery acquainted with (see Basic tutorial 10: GStreamer tools to learn about\ngst-launch-1.0 and the\ngst-launch-1.0 syntax).\n"});
