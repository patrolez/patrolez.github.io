In this way, you\nhave all debug output in the same file and the temporal relationship\nbetween different messages is preserved.\nTo do so, use the GST_ERROR(), GST_WARNING(), GST_INFO(),\nGST_LOG() and GST_DEBUG() macros. They accept the same parameters as\nprintf, and they use the default category (default will be shown\nas the Debug category in the output log).\nTo change the category to something more meaningful, add these two lines\nat the top of your code:\nAnd then this one after you have initialized GStreamer with\ngst_init():\nThis registers a new category (this is, for the duration of your\napplication: it is not stored in any file), and sets it as the default\ncategory for your code. See the documentation\nfor GST_DEBUG_CATEGORY_INIT().\n"});
