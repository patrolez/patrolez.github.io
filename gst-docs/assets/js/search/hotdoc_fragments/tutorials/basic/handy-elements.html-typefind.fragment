It applies\ntypefind functions in the order of their rank. Once the type has been\ndetected it sets its source Pad Caps to the found media type and emits\nthe have-type signal.\nIt is instantiated internally by decodebin, and you can use it too to\nfind the media type, although you can normally use the\nGstDiscoverer which provides more information (as seen in\nBasic tutorial 9: Media information gathering).\n"});
