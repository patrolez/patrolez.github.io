It\ninvokes a file chooser dialog (based on the Android File\nDialog project) that\nallows you to choose a local media file, no matter what extension or\nMIME type it has.\nIf a new media is selected, it is passed onto the native code (which\nwill set the pipeline to READY, pass the URI onto playbin, and bring\nthe pipeline back to the previous state). The current position is also\nreset, so the new clip does not start in the previous position.\n"});
