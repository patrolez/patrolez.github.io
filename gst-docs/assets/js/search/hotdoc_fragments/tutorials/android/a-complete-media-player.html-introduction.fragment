This one\nsimply adds a few finishing touches. In particular, it adds the\ncapability to choose the media to play, and disables the screensaver\nduring media playback.\nThese are not features directly related to GStreamer, and are therefore\noutside the scope of these tutorials. Only a few implementation pointers\nare given here.\n"});
