fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/android/media-player.html#reporting-media-size1","fragment":"Reporting media size\nSome codecs allow the media size (width and height of the video) to\nchange during playback. For simplicity, this tutorial assumes that they\ndo not. Therefore, in the READY to PAUSED state change, once the Caps of\nthe decoded media are known, we inspect them in check_media_size():\nWe first retrieve the video sink element from the pipeline, using the\nvideo-sink property of playbin, and then its sink Pad. The\nnegotiated Caps of this Pad, which we recover using\ngst_pad_get_negotiated_caps(),  are the Caps of the decoded media.\nThe helper functions gst_video_format_parse_caps() and\ngst_video_parse_caps_pixel_aspect_ratio() turn the Caps into\nmanageable integers, which we pass to Java through\nits onMediaSizeChanged() callback.\n"});
