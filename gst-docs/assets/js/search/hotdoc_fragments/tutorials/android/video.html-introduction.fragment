fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/android/video.html#introduction","fragment":"Introduction\nSince Android does not provide a windowing system, a GStreamer video\nsink cannot create pop-up windows as it would do on a Desktop platform.\nFortunately, the VideoOverlay interface allows providing video sinks with\nan already created window onto which they can draw, as we have seen in\nBasic tutorial 5: GUI toolkit integration.\nIn this tutorial, a\nSurfaceView\nwidget (actually, a subclass of it) is placed on the main layout. When\nAndroid informs the application that a surface has been created for this\nwidget, we pass it to the C code which stores it. The\ncheck_initialization_complete() method explained in the previous\ntutorial is extended so that GStreamer is not considered initialized\nuntil a main loop is running and a drawing surface has been received.\n"});
