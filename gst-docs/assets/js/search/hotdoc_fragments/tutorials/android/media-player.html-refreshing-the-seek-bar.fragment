The implementation on Android is very similar.\nThe Seek Bar accomplishes to functions: First, it moves on its own to\nreflect the current playback position in the media. Second, it can be\ndragged by the user to seek to a different position.\nTo realize the first function, C code will periodically call our\nsetCurrentPosition() method so we can update the position of the thumb\nin the Seek Bar. Again we do so from the UI thread, using\nRunOnUiThread().\nTo the left of the Seek Bar (refer to the screenshot at the top of this\npage), there is a\nTextView\nwidget which we will use to display the current position and duration in\nHH:mm:ss / HH:mm:ss textual format. The updateTimeWidget() method\ntakes care of it, and must be called every time the Seek Bar is updated:\n"});
