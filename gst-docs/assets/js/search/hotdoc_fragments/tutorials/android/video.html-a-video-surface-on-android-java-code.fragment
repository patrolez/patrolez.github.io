Only the parts of the code that are new will be\ndiscussed.\nTwo new entry points to the C code are defined,\nnativeSurfaceInit() and nativeSurfaceFinalize(), which we will call\nwhen the video surface becomes available and when it is about to be\ndestroyed, respectively.\nIn onCreate(), we retrieve the\nSurfaceView,\nand then register ourselves to receive notifications about the surface\nstate through the\nSurfaceHolder\ninterface. This is why we declared this Activity as implementing the\nSurfaceHolder.Callback\ninterface in line 16.\nThis interface is composed of the three methods above, which get called\nwhen the geometry of the surface changes, when the surface is created\nand when it is about to be destroyed. surfaceChanged() always gets\ncalled at least once, right after surfaceCreated(), so we will use it\nto notify GStreamer about the new surface. We use\nsurfaceDestroyed() to tell GStreamer to stop using this surface.\nLetâ€™s review the C code to see what these functions do.\n"});
