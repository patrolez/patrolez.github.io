By specifying in the intent-filter of the activity\nthat it understands the audio/*, video/* and image/* MIME types,\nthe tutorial will be offered as an option whenever an application\nrequires such medias to be viewed.\n“Unfortunately”, GStreamer knows more file formats than Android does,\nso, for some files, Android will not provide a MIME type. For these\ncases, a new intent-filter has to be provided which ignores MIME types\nand focuses only in the filename extension. This is inconvenient because\nthe list of extensions can be large, but there does not seem to be\nanother option. In this tutorial, only a very short list of extensions\nis provided, for simplicity.\nFinally, GStreamer can also playback remote files, so URI schemes like\nhttp are supported in another intent-filter. Android does not\nprovide MIME types for remote files, so the filename extension list has\nto be provided again.\nOnce we have informed the system of our capabilities, it will start\nsending\nIntents\nto invoke our activity, which will contain the desired URI to play. In\nthe onCreate() method the intent that invoked the activity is\nretrieved and checked for such URI.\n"});
