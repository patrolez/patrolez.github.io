If the user is searching for a particular scene, we\ndo not want it to keep\nmoving.\nonProgressChanged() is\ncalled every time the thumb moves, be it because the user dragged it, or\nbecause we called setProgress() on the Seek Bar. We discard the latter\ncase with the handy fromUser parameter.\nAs the comment says, if this is a local media, we allow scrub seeking,\nthis is, we jump to the indicated position as soon as the thumb moves.\nOtherwise, the seek will be performed when the thumb is released, and\nthe only thing we do here is update the textual time widget.\nFinally, onStopTrackingTouch()\nis called when the thumb is released. We simply perform the seek\noperation if the file was non-local, and restore the pipeline to the\ndesired playing state.\nThis concludes the User interface part of this tutorial. Let’s review\nnow the under-the-hood C code that allows this to work.\n"});
