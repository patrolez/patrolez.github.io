While this might be convenient sometimes, it does\nnot allow a great deal of control. In particular, when the surface does\nnot have the same aspect ratio as the media, the sink will add black\nborders (the known “letterbox” or “pillarbox” effect), which is an\nunnecessary work (and a waste of battery).\nThe subclass of\nSurfaceView presented\nhere overrides the\nonMeasure() method\nto report the actual media size, so the surface can adapt to any layout\nwhile preserving the media aspect ratio.\nSince in this tutorial the media size is known beforehand, it is\nhardcoded in the GStreamerSurfaceView class for simplicity. The next\ntutorial shows how it can be recovered at runtime and passed onto the\nsurface.\nsrc/org/freedesktop/gstreamer/tutorials/tutorial_3/GStreamerSurfaceView.java\n"});
