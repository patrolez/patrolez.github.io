Since playbin will be taking care of\nretrieving the media, we can use local or remote URIs indistinctly\n(file:// or http://, for example). From Java, though, we want to\nkeep track of whether the file is local or remote, because we will not\noffer the same functionalities. We keep track of this in the\nis_local_media variable, and update it every time we change the media\nURI:\nWe call setMediaUri() in the onGStreamerInitialized() callback, once\nthe pipeline is ready to accept commands.\n"});
