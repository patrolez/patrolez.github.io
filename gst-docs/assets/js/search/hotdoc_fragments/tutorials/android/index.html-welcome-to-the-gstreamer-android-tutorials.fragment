General GStreamer\nconcepts will not be explained in these tutorials, so the\nBasic tutorials should be reviewed first. The reader should\nalso be familiar with basic Android programming techniques.\nEach Android tutorial builds on top of the previous one and adds\nprogressively more functionality, until a working media player\napplication is obtained in Android tutorial 5: A Complete media player.\nThis is the same media player application used to advertise\nGStreamer on Android, and the download link can be found in\nthe Android tutorial 5: A Complete media player page.\nMake sure to have read the instructions in\nInstalling for Android development before jumping into the\nAndroid tutorials.\n"});
