Here, we:\n\nInstruct the GLib main loop to quit with g_main_loop_quit(). This\ncall returns immediately, and the main loop will terminate at its\nearliest convenience.\nWait for the thread to finish with\npthread_join().\nThis call blocks until the app_function() method returns, meaning\nthat the main loop has exited, and the thread has been destroyed.\nDispose of the global reference we kept for the Java application\nclass (Tutorial2) in CustomData.\nFree CustomData and set the Java pointer inside the\nTutorial2 class to NULL with\nSET_CUSTOM_DATA().\n\n"});
