For each method, it provides its Java\nname, its type\nsignature\nand a pointer to the C function implementing it:\nThe only native method used in this tutorial\nis nativeGetGStreamerInfo():\nIt simply calls gst_version_string() to obtain a string describing\nthis version of GStreamer. This Modified\nUTF8 string is then\nconverted to UTF16 by NewStringUTF() as required by Java and returned. Java will be\nresponsible for freeing the memory used by the new UTF16 String, but we\nmust free the char * returned by gst_version_string().\n"});
