When one is selected, the\nVideoViewController from iOS tutorial 4: A basic media player appears\nand its URI property is set to the URI of the selected clip.\nThe list of clips is populated from three sources: Media from the\ndevice’s Photo library, Media from the application’s Documents folder\n(accessible through iTunes file sharing) and a list of hardcoded\nInternet addresses, selected to showcase different container and codec\nformats, and a couple of bogus ones, to illustrate error reporting.\n"});
