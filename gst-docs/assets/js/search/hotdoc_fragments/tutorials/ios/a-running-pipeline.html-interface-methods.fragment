The app_function monitors the GStreamer bus for messages and\nwarns the application when interesting things happen.\ninit: also registers a new GStreamer debug category and sets its\nthreshold, so we can see the debug output from within Xcode and keep\ntrack of our application progress.\nThe dealloc method takes care of bringing the pipeline to the NULL\nstate and releasing it.\nThe play and pause methods simply try to set the pipeline to the\ndesired state and warn the application if something fails.\n"});
