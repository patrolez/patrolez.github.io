The most complex part is assembling a\npipeline which retrieves, decodes and displays the media, but we\nalready know that the playbin element can take care of all that for\nus. We only need to replace the manual pipeline we used in\niOS tutorial 3: Video with a single-element playbin pipeline\nand we are good to go!\nHowever, we can do better than. We will add a Time\nSlider,\nwith a moving thumb that will advance as our current position in the\nmedia advances. We will also allow the user to drag the thumb, to jump\n(or seek) to a different position.\nAnd finally, we will make the video surface adapt to the media size, so\nthe video sink is not forced to draw black borders around the clip.\nThis also allows the iOS layout to adapt more nicely to the actual\nmedia content. You can still force the video surface to have a specific\nsize if you really want to.\n"});
