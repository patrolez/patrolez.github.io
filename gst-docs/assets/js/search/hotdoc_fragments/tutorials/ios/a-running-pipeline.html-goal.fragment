However, platforms\nlike iOS or Android do not use GLib and therefore extra care must be\ntaken to keep track of the pipeline progress without blocking the user\ninterface (UI).\nThis tutorial shows:\n\nHow to move the GStreamer-handling code to a separate Dispatch Queue\nwhereas UI managing still happens from the Main Dispatch Queue\nHow to communicate between the Objective-C UI code and the C\nGStreamer code\n\n"});
