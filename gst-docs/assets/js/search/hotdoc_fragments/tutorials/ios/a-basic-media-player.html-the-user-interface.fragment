A\nUISlider has been added to the toolbar, to keep track of the current\nposition in the clip, and allow the user to change it. Also, a\n(read-only) UITextField is added to show the exact clip position and\nduration.\nVideoViewController.h\nNote how we register callbacks for some of the Actions the\nUISlider generates.\nAlso note that the class has been renamed from ViewController to\nVideoViewController, since the next tutorial adds another\nViewController and we will need to differentiate.\n"});
