After a\nshort period of such inactivity, iOS will dim the screen, and then turn\nit off completely. To prevent this, the idleTimerDisabled property of\nthe UIApplication class is used. The application sets it to YES\n(screen locking disabled) when the Play button is pressed, so the screen\nis never turned off, and sets it back to NO when the Pause button is\npressed.\n"});
