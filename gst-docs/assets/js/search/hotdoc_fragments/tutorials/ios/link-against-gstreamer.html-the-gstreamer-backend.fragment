In successive tutorials it will get expanded, but,\nfor now, it only contains a method to retrieve the GStreamer version.\nThe GStreamerBackend is made in Objective-C so it can take care of the\nfew C-to-Objective-C conversions that might be necessary (like char * to NSString *, for example). This eases the usage of this class by\nthe UI code, which is typically made in pure Objective-C.\nGStreamerBackend serves exactly the same purpose as the JNI code in\nthe Android tutorials.\nGStreamerBackend.m\nThe getGStreamerVersion() method simply calls\ngst_version_string() to obtain a string describing this version of\nGStreamer. This Modified\nUTF8 string is then\nconverted to a NSString * by NSString:stringWithUTF8Stringand\nreturned. Objective-C will take care of freeing the memory used by the\nnew NSString *, but we need to free the char * returned\nby gst_version_string().\n"});
