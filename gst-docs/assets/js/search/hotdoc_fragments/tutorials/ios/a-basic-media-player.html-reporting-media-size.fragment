For simplicity, this tutorial assumes that they\ndo not. Therefore, in the READY to PAUSED state change, once the Caps of\nthe decoded media are known, we inspect them in check_media_size():\nWe first retrieve the video sink element from the pipeline, using\nthe video-sink property of playbin, and then its sink Pad. The\nnegotiated Caps of this Pad, which we recover using\ngst_pad_get_current_caps(),  are the Caps of the decoded media.\nThe helper functions gst_video_format_parse_caps() and\ngst_video_parse_caps_pixel_aspect_ratio() turn the Caps into\nmanageable integers, which we pass to the application through\nits mediaSizeChanged callback.\n"});
