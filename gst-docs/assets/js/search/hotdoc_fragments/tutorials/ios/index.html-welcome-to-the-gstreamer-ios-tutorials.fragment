General GStreamer\nconcepts will not be explained in these tutorials, so the\nBasic tutorials should be reviewed first. The reader should\nalso be familiar with basic iOS programming techniques.\nThe iOS tutorials have the same structure as the\nAndroid tutorials: Each one builds on top of the previous\none and adds progressively more functionality, until a working media\nplayer application is obtained in\niOS tutorial 5: A Complete media player.\nMake sure to have read the instructions in\nInstalling for iOS development before jumping into the iOS\ntutorials.\nAll iOS tutorials are split into the following classes:\n\nThe GStreamerBackend class performs all GStreamer-related tasks\nand offers a simplified interface to the application, which does not\nneed to deal with all the GStreamer details. When it needs to\nperform any UI action, it does so through a delegate, which is\nexpected to adhere to the GStreamerBackendDelegate protocol.\nThe ViewController class manages the UI, instantiates the\nGStreamerBackend and also performs some UI-related tasks on its\nbehalf.\nThe GStreamerBackendDelegate protocol defines which methods a\nclass can implement in order to serve as a UI delegate for the\nGStreamerBackend.\n\n"});
