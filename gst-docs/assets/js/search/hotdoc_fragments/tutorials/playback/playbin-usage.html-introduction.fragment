The most common case are regular\nmovies, which contain one video and one audio stream (Stereo or 5.1\naudio tracks are considered a single stream). It is also increasingly\ncommon to find movies with one video and multiple audio streams, to\naccount for different languages. In this case, the user selects one\naudio stream, and the application will only play that one, ignoring the\nothers.\nTo be able to select the appropriate stream, the user needs to know\ncertain information about them, for example, their language. This\ninformation is embedded in the streams in the form of “metadata”\n(annexed data), and this tutorial shows how to retrieve it.\nSubtitles can also be embedded in a file, along with audio and video,\nbut they are dealt with in more detail in Playback tutorial 2: Subtitle\nmanagement. Finally, multiple video streams can also be found in a\nsingle file, for example, in DVD with multiple angles of the same scene,\nbut they are somewhat rare.\n Embedding multiple streams inside a single file is\ncalled “multiplexing” or “muxing”, and such file is then known as a\n“container”. Common container formats are Matroska (.mkv), Quicktime\n(.qt, .mov, .mp4), Ogg (.ogg) or Webm (.webm).\nRetrieving the individual streams from within the container is called\n“demultiplexing” or “demuxing”.\nThe following code recovers the amount of streams in the file, their\nassociated metadata, and allows switching the audio stream while the\nmedia is playing.\n"});
