This is\nconvenient because the audio signal then travels from the computer to\nthe speakers in a form that is more resilient to interference and noise,\nresulting higher quality.\nThe connection is typically made through an\nS/PDIF cable which can either be\noptical (with TOSLINK\nconnectors) or coaxial (with RCA\nconnectors). S/PDIF is also known as IEC 60958 type II (IEC 958 before\n1998).\nIn this scenario, GStreamer does not need to perform audio decoding; it\ncan simply output the encoded data, acting in pass-through mode, and\nlet the external audio system perform the decoding.\n"});
