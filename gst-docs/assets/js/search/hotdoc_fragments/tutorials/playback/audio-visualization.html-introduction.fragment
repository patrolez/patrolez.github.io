Just\nset the appropriate playbin flag and, when an audio-only stream is\nfound, it will instantiate the necessary elements to create and display\nthe visualization.\nIf you want to specify the actual element that you want to use to\ngenerate the visualization, you instantiate it yourself and then tell\nplaybin about it through the vis-plugin property.\nThis tutorial searches the GStreamer registry for all the elements of\nthe Visualization class, tries to select goom (or another one if it is\nnot available) and passes it to playbin.\n"});
