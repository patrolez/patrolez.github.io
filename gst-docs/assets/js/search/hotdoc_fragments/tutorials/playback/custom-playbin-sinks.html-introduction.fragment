The application\nonly needs to instantiate the appropriate GstElement and pass it to\nplaybin through these properties.\nThis method, though, only allows using a single Element as sink. If a\nmore complex pipeline is required, for example, an equalizer plus an\naudio sink, it needs to be wrapped in a Bin, so it looks to\nplaybin as if it was a single Element.\nA Bin (GstBin) is a container that encapsulates partial pipelines so\nthey can be managed as single elements. As an example, the\nGstPipeline we have been using in all tutorials is a type of\nGstBin, which does not interact with external Elements. Elements\ninside a Bin connect to external elements through Ghost Pads\n(GstGhostPad), this is, Pads on the surface of the Bin which simply\nforward data from an external Pad to a given Pad on an internal Element.\n\nFigure 1: A Bin with two Elements and one Ghost Pad.\nGstBins are also a type of GstElement, so they can be used wherever\nan Element is required, in particular, as sinks for playbin (and they\nare then known as sink-bins).\n"});
