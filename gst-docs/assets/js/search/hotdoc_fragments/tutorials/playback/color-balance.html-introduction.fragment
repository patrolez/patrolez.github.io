If any of the\nelements in the playbin pipeline support this interface,\nplaybin simply forwards it to the application, otherwise, a\ncolorbalance element is inserted in the pipeline.\nThis interface allows querying for the available color balance channels\n(GstColorBalanceChannel), along with their name and valid range of\nvalues, and then modify the current value of any of them.\n"});
