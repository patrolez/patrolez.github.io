This tutorial (more of a lecture,\nactually) gives some background on hardware acceleration and explains\nhow does GStreamer benefit from it.\nSneak peek: if properly setup, you do not need to do anything special to\nactivate hardware acceleration; GStreamer automatically takes advantage\nof it.\n"});
