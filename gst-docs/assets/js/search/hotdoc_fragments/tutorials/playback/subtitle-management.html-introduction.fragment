fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/playback/subtitle-management.html#introduction","fragment":"Introduction\nWe already know (from the previous tutorial) that container files can\nhold multiple audio and video streams, and that we can very easily\nchoose among them by changing the current-audio or\ncurrent-video playbin property. Switching subtitles is just as\neasy.\nIt is worth noting that, just like it happens with audio and video,\nplaybin takes care of choosing the right decoder for the subtitles,\nand that the plugin structure of GStreamer allows adding support for new\nformats as easily as copying a file. Everything is invisible to the\napplication developer.\nBesides subtitles embedded in the container, playbin offers the\npossibility to add an extra subtitle stream from an external URI.\nThis tutorial opens a file which already contains 5 subtitle streams,\nand adds another one from another file (for the Greek language).\n"});
