This is so because there is\nno mechanism to query an external audio decoder which formats are\nsupported, and, in fact, the cable can even be disconnected during this\nprocess.\nFor example, after enabling Digital Audio Output in the system’s Control\nPanel,  directsoundsink  will automatically expose audio/x-ac3,\naudio/x-eac3 and audio/x-dts caps in addition to audio/x-raw.\nHowever, one particular external decoder might only understand raw\ninteger streams and would try to play the compressed data as such (a\npainful experience for your ears, rest assured).\nSolving this issue requires user intervention, since only the user knows\nthe formats supported by the external decoder.\nOn some systems, the simplest solution is to inform the operating system\nof the formats that the external audio decoder can accept. In this way,\nthe GStreamer audio sinks will only offer these formats. The acceptable\naudio formats are commonly selected from the operating system’s audio\nconfiguration panel, from the same place where Digital Audio Output is\nenabled, but, unfortunately, this option is not available in all audio\ndrivers.\nAnother solution involves, using a custom sinkbin (see\nPlayback tutorial 7: Custom playbin sinks) which includes a\ncapsfilter element (see Basic tutorial 14: Handy elements)\nand an audio sink. The caps that the external decoder supports are\nthen set in the capsfiler so the wrong format is not output. This\nallows the application to enforce the appropriate format instead of\nrelying on the user to have the system correctly configured. Still\nrequires user intervention, but can be used regardless of the options\nthe audio driver offers.\nPlease do not use autoaudiosink as the audio sink, as it currently\nonly supports raw audio, and will ignore any compressed format.\n"});
