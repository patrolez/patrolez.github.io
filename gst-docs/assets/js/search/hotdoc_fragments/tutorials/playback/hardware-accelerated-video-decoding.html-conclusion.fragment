Particularly,\nIt has been a pleasure having you here, and see you soon!\n\nApplications do not need to do anything special to enable hardware\nacceleration if a suitable API and the corresponding GStreamer\nplugin are available.\nHardware acceleration can be enabled or disabled by changing the\nrank of the decoding element with gst_plugin_feature_set_rank().\n\n"});
