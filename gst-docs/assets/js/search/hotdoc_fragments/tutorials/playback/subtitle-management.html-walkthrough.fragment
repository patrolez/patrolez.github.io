fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/playback/subtitle-management.html#walkthrough","fragment":"Walkthrough\nThis tutorial is copied from\nPlayback tutorial 1: Playbin usage with some changes, so let's\nreview only the changes.\nAfter setting the media URI, we set the suburi property, which points\nplaybin to a file containing a subtitle stream. In this case, the\nmedia file already contains multiple subtitle streams, so the one\nprovided in the suburi is added to the list, and will be the currently\nselected one.\nNote that metadata concerning a subtitle stream (like its language)\nresides in the container file, therefore, subtitles not embedded in a\ncontainer will not have metadata. When running this tutorial you will\nfind that the first subtitle stream does not have a language tag.\nThe subtitle-font-desc property allows specifying the font to render\nthe subtitles. Since Pango is the library used\nto render fonts, you can check its documentation to see how this font\nshould be specified, in particular, the\npango-font-description-from-string function.\nIn a nutshell, the format of the string representation is [FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE] where FAMILY-LIST is a comma separated list of\nfamilies optionally terminated by a comma, STYLE_OPTIONS is a\nwhitespace separated list of words where each word describes one of\nstyle, variant, weight, or stretch, and SIZE is an decimal number\n(size in points). For example the following are all valid string\nrepresentations:\nThe commonly available font families are: Normal, Sans, Serif and\nMonospace.\nThe available styles are: Normal (the font is upright), Oblique (the\nfont is slanted, but in a roman style), Italic (the font is slanted in\nan italic style).\nThe available weights are: Ultra-Light, Light, Normal, Bold, Ultra-Bold,\nHeavy.\nThe available variants are: Normal, Small_Caps (A font with the lower\ncase characters replaced by smaller variants of the capital characters)\nThe available stretch styles\nare: Ultra-Condensed, Extra-Condensed, Condensed, Semi-Condensed, Normal, Semi-Expanded, Expanded,\nExtra-Expanded, Ultra-Expanded\nWe set the flags property to allow Audio, Video and Text (Subtitles).\nThe rest of the tutorial is the same as Playback tutorial 1: Playbin usage, except\nthat the keyboard input changes the current-text property instead of\nthe current-audio. As before, keep in mind that stream changes are not\nimmediate, since there is a lot of information flowing through the\npipeline that needs to reach the end of it before the new stream shows\nup.\n\nsans bold 12\nserif, monospace bold italic condensed 16\nnormal 10\n\n"});
