fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tutorials/playback/progressive-streaming.html#introduction","fragment":"Introduction\nWhen streaming, data is fetched from the network and a small buffer of\nfuture-data is kept to ensure smooth playback (see\nBasic tutorial 12: Streaming). However, data\nis discarded as soon as it is displayed or rendered (there is no\npast-data buffer). This means, that if a user wants to jump back and\ncontinue playback from a point in the past, data needs to be\nre-downloaded.\nMedia players tailored for streaming, like YouTube, usually keep all\ndownloaded data stored locally for this contingency. A graphical widget\nis also normally used to show how much of the file has already been\ndownloaded.\nplaybin offers similar functionalities through the DOWNLOAD flag\nwhich stores the media in a local temporary file for faster playback of\nalready-downloaded chunks.\nThis code also shows how to use the Buffering Query, which allows\nknowing what parts of the file are available.\n"});
