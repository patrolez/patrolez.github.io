A playbin pipeline is\ninstantiated and set to run, and a keyboard watch is installed so\nkeystrokes can be monitored.\nThis method prints the current value for all channels, and exemplifies\nhow to retrieve the list of channels. This is accomplished through the\ngst_color_balance_list_channels() method. It returns a GList which\nneeds to be traversed.\nEach element in the list is a GstColorBalanceChannel structure,\ninforming of the channelâ€™s name, minimum value and maximum value.\ngst_color_balance_get_value() can then be called on each channel to\nretrieve the current value.\nIn this example, the minimum and maximum values are used to output the\ncurrent value as a percentage.\nThis method locates the specified channel by name and increases or\ndecreases it as requested. Again, the list of channels is retrieved and\nparsed looking for the channel with the specified name. Obviously, this\nlist could be parsed only once and the pointers to the channels be\nstored and indexed by something more efficient than a string.\nThe current value for the channel is then retrieved, changed (the\nincrement is proportional to its dynamic range), clamped (to avoid\nout-of-range values) and set using gst_color_balance_set_value().\nAnd there is not much more to it. Run the program and observe the effect\nof changing each of the channels in real time.\n"});
