If you have not done so yet, go\nto the installing GStreamer page and come back here afterwards.\nThe tutorials are currently written only in the C programming language,\nso you need to be comfortable with it. Even though C is not an\nObject-Oriented (OO) language per se, the GStreamer framework uses\nGObjects, so some knowledge of OO concepts will come in handy.\nKnowledge of the GObject and GLib libraries is not mandatory, but\nwill make the trip easier.\n"});
