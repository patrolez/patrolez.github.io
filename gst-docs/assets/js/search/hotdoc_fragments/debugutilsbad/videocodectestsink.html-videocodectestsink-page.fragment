This element is\nmeant to be used for CODEC conformance testing. It also supports producing an I420\nchecksum and and can write out a file in I420 layout directly from NV12 input\ndata.\nThe checksum is communicated back to the application just before EOS\nmessage with an element message of type conformance/checksum with the\nfollowing fields:\n\n\"checksum-type\"  G_TYPE_STRING The checksum type (only MD5 is supported)\n\"checksum\"       G_TYPE_STRING The checksum as a string\n\n"});
