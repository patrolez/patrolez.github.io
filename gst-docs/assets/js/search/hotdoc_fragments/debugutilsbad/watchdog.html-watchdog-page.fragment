If no buffers are seen for a configurable amount of\ntime, a error message is sent to the bus.\nTo use this element, insert it into a pipeline as you would an\nidentity element.  Once activated, any pause in the flow of\nbuffers through the element will cause an element error.  The\nmaximum allowed pause is determined by the timeout property.\nThis element is currently intended for transcoding pipelines,\nalthough may be useful in other contexts.\n"});
