The simplest way is to use a standard 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable\nto connect line-out to line-in, or speaker-out to mic-in, etc.\nCapturing speaker output with a microphone should also work, as long as the\nambient noise level is low enough. You may have to adjust the microphone gain\nto ensure that the volume is loud enough to be detected by the element, and\nat the same time that it's not so loud that it picks up ambient noise.\nFor programmatic use, instead of using 'print-stats', you should read the\n'last-latency' and 'average-latency' properties at most once a second, or\nparse the \"latency\" element message, which contains the \"last-latency\" and\n\"average-latency\" fields in the GstStructure.\nThe average latency is a running average of the last 5 measurements.\n"});
