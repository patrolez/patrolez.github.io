fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"camerabin/camerabin.html#usage","fragment":"Usage\nCamerabin can be created using gst_element_factory_make just like\nany other element. Video or image capture mode can be selected using\nthe mode property and the file to save the capture is\nselected using location property.\nAfter creating camerabin, applications might want to do some\ncustomization (there's a section about this below), then select\nthe desired mode and start capturing.\nIn image capture mode, just send a start-capture and a\npicture will be captured. When the picture is stored on the selected\nlocation, a GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT named 'image-done' will be posted on\nthe GstBus.\nIn video capture mode, send a start-capture to start\nrecording, then send a stop-capture to stop recording.\nNote that both signals are asynchronous, so, calling\nstop-capture doesn't guarantee that the video has been\nproperly finished yet. Applications should wait for the 'video-done'\nmessage to be posted on the bus.\nIn both modes, if post-previews is TRUE, a GstBuffer\nwill be post to the GstBus in a field named 'buffer', in a\n'preview-image' message of type GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT.\n"});
