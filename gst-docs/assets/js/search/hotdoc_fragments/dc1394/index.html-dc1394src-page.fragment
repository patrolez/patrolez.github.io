If several cameras are connected to the system, the desired one\ncan be selected by its GUID and an optional unit number (most cameras are\nsingle unit and do not require it). The frame size, rate and format are set\nfrom capabilities. Although the IIDC specification includes a raw video\nmode, many cameras use mono video modes to capture in Bayer format.\nThus, for each mono video mode supported by a camera, both gray raw and Bayer\ncorresponding video formats are exposed in the capabilities.\nThe Bayer pattern is left unspecified.\n"});
