fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"audioresample/index.html#audioresample-page","fragment":"audioresample\naudioresample resamples raw audio buffers to different sample rates using\na configurable windowing function to enhance quality.\nBy default, the resampler uses a reduced sinc table, with cubic interpolation filling in\nthe gaps. This ensures that the table does not become too big. However, the interpolation\nincreases the CPU usage considerably. As an alternative, a full sinc table can be used.\nDoing so can drastically reduce CPU usage (4x faster with 44.1 -> 48 kHz conversions for\nexample), at the cost of increased memory consumption, plus the sinc table takes longer\nto initialize when the element is created. A third mode exists, which uses the full table\nunless said table would become too large, in which case the interpolated one is used instead.\n"});
