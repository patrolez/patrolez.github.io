See below for\nmore details on these messages and how to extract the pixbuf object\ncontained in them.\nRetrieving the current pixbuf via the last-pixbuf property\nwhen needed. This is the easiest way to get at pixbufs for snapshotting\npurposes - just wait until the pipeline is prerolled (ASYNC_DONE message\non the bus), then read the property. If you use this method, you may want\nto disable message posting by setting the post-messages\nproperty to FALSE. This avoids unnecessary memory overhead.\nThe primary purpose of this element is to abstract away the GstBuffer to\nGdkPixbuf conversion. Other than that it's very similar to the fakesink\nelement.\nThis element is meant for easy no-hassle video snapshotting. It is not\nsuitable for video playback or video display at high framerates. Use\nximagesink, xvimagesink or some other suitable video sink in connection\nwith the GstVideoOverlay interface instead if you want to do video playback.\n\n\nWatching for element messages named preroll-pixbuf or pixbuf on the bus, which\nwill be posted whenever an image would usually be rendered.
