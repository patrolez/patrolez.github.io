fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gdkpixbuf/gdkpixbufsink.html#message-details","fragment":"Message details\nAs mentioned above, this element will by default post element messages\ncontaining structures named preroll-pixbuf\norpixbuf` on the bus (this\ncan be disabled by setting the post-messages property\nto FALSE though). The element message structure has the following fields:\n\n\npixbuf: the GdkPixbuf object\n\npixel-aspect-ratio: the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the input image\n(this field contains a value of type GST_TYPE_FRACTION); the\nPAR is usually 1:1 for images, but is often something non-1:1 in the case\nof video input. In this case the image may be distorted and you may need\nto rescale it accordingly before saving it to file or displaying it. This\ncan easily be done using gdk_pixbuf_scale (the reason this is not done\nautomatically is that the application will often scale the image anyway\naccording to the size of the output window, in which case it is much more\nefficient to only scale once rather than twice). You can put a videoscale\nelement and a capsfilter element with\nvideo/x-raw-rgb,pixel-aspect-ratio=(fraction)1/1 caps\nin front of this element to make sure the pixbufs always have a 1:1 PAR.\n\n"});
