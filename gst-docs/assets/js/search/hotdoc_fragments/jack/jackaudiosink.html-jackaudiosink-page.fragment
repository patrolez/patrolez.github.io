fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"jack/jackaudiosink.html#jackaudiosink-page","fragment":"jackaudiosink\nA Sink that outputs data to Jack ports.\nIt will create N Jack ports named out_<name>_<num> where\n<name> is the element name and <num> is starting from 1.\nEach port corresponds to a gstreamer channel.\nThe samplerate as exposed on the caps is always the same as the samplerate of\nthe jack server.\nWhen the connect property is set to auto, this element\nwill try to connect each output port to a random physical jack input pin. In\nthis mode, the sink will expose the number of physical channels on its pad\ncaps.\nWhen the connect property is set to none, the element will\naccept any number of input channels and will create (but not connect) an\noutput port for each channel.\nThe element will generate an error when the Jack server is shut down when it\nwas PAUSED or PLAYING. This element does not support dynamic rate and buffer\nsize changes at runtime.\n"});
