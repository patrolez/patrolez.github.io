fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"audiomixmatrix/index.html#audiomixmatrix-page","fragment":"audiomixmatrix\nThis element transforms a given number of input channels into a given\nnumber of output channels according to a given transformation matrix. The\nmatrix coefficients must be between -1 and 1: the number of rows is equal\nto the number of output channels and the number of columns is equal to the\nnumber of input channels. In the first-channels mode, input/output channels\nare automatically negotiated and the transformation matrix is a truncated\nidentity matrix.\n"});
