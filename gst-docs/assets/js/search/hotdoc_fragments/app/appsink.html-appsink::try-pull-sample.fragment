All rendered samples will be put in a queue so that the application\ncan pull samples at its own rate.\nNote that when the application does not pull samples fast enough, the\nqueued samples could consume a lot of memory, especially when dealing with\nraw video frames. It's possible to control the behaviour of the queue with\nthe \"drop\" and \"max-buffers\" / \"max-bytes\" / \"max-time\" set of properties.\nIf an EOS event was received before any buffers or the timeout expires,\nthis function returns NULL. Use gst_app_sink_is_eos () to check\nfor the EOS condition.\nParameters:\nthe appsink element to emit this signal on\nthe maximum amount of time to wait for a sample\na GstSample or NULL when the appsink is stopped or EOS or the timeout expires.\n\n\tFlags:\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRun Last\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t/\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAction\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.10\n\t\t\n"});
