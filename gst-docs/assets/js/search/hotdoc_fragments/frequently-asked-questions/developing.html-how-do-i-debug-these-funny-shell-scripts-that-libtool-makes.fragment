For instance, to debug gst-launch, try:\nIf this does not work, you're probably using a broken version of\nlibtool.\nIf you build GStreamer using the Meson build system, libtool will not\nbe used and this is not a problem. You can run gdb, valgrind or any\ndebugging tools directly on the binaries Meson creates in the build\ndirectory.\n"});
