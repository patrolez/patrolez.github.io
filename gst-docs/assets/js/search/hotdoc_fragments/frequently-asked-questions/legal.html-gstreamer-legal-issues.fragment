These\nquestions were answered by the FSF lawyers, so we\nview them as the final interpretation on how the GPL and LGPL interact\nwith patents in our opinion. This consultancy was paid for by\nFluendo in order to obtain clear and quotable\nanswers. These answers were certified by the FSF lawyer team and\nverified by FSF lawyer and law professor Eben Moglen.\nCan someone distribute the combination of:\ntogether in one distribution/operating system? If not, what needs to be\nchanged to make this possible?\nThis would be a problem, because the GStreamer and MyPlayer\nlicenses would forbid it. In order to link GStreamer to MyPlayer, you\nneed to use section 3 of the LGPL to convert GStreamer to GPL. The GPL\nversion of GStreamer forbids linking to the Sorenson decoder. Anyway,\nthe MyPlayer GPL license forbids this.\nIf the authors of MyPlayer want to permit this, we have an exception for\nthem: the controlled interface exception from the FAQ. The idea of this\nis that you can't get around the GPL just by including a LGPL bit in the\nmiddle.\nNote: MyPlayer is a completely fictituous application at the time of\nwriting.\nSuppose Apple wants to write a binary-only proprietary plugin for GStreamer\n.. to decode Sorenson video, which will be shipped stand-alone,\nnot part of a package like in the question above. Can Apple distribute\nthis binary-only plugin?\nYes, modulo certain reverse engineering requirements in section 6\nof the LGPL.\nIf a program released under the GPL uses a library that is LGPL, and\nthis library can dlopen plug-ins at runtime, what are the requirements\nfor the license of the plug-in?\nYou may not distribute the plug-in with the GPL application.\nDistributing the plug-in alone, with the knowledge that it will be used\nprimarily by GPL software is a bit of an edge case. We will not advise\nyou that it would be safe to do so, but we also will not advise you that\nit would be absolutely forbidden.\nCan someone in a country that does not have software patents\ndistribute code covered by US patents under the GPL to people in, for\nexample, Norway? If he/she visits the US, can he/she be arrested?\nYes, he can. No, there are no criminal penalties for patent\ninfringement in the US.\nCan someone from the US distribute software covered by US patents\nunder the GPL to people in Norway? To people in the US?\nThis might infringe some patents, but the GPL would not forbid it\nabsent some actual restriction, such as a court judgement or agreement.\nThe US government is empowered to refuse importation of patent\ninfringing devices, including software.\nThere are a lot of GPL- or LGPL-licensed libraries that handle media\ncodecs which have patents. Take mad, an mp3 decoding library, as an\nexample. It is licensed under the GPL. In countries where patents are\nvalid, does this invalidate the GPL license for this project?\nThe mere existence of a patent which might read on the program\ndoes not change anything. However, if a court judgement or other\nagreement prevents you from distributing libmad under GPL terms, you can\nnot distribute it at all.\nThe GPL and LGPL say (sections 7 and 11): “If you cannot distribute so\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\nother pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\ndistribute the Library at all.”\nSo let's say there is a court judgement. Does this mean that the GPL\nlicense is invalid for the project everywhere, or only in the\ncountries where it conflicts with the applicable patents?\nThe GPL operates on a per-action, not per-program basis. That is,\nif you are in a country which has software patents, and a court tells\nyou that you cannot distribute (say) libmad in source code form, then\nyou cannot distribute libmad at all. This doesn't affect anyone else.\nPatented decoding can be implemented in GStreamer either by having a\nbinary-only plugin do the decoding, or by writing a plugin (with any\napplicable license) that links to a binary-only library. Does this\naffect the licensing issues involved in regards to GPL/LGPL?\nNo.\nIs it correct that you cannot distribute the GPL mad library to decode\nmp3's, even in the case where you have obtained a valid license for\ndecoding mp3?\nThe only GPL-compatible patent licenses are those which are open\nto all parties posessing copies of GPL software which practices the\nteachings of the patent.\nIf you take a license which doesn't allow others to distribute original\nor modified versions of libmad practicing the same patent claims as the\nversion you distribute, then you may not distribute at all.\n\nGStreamer, the LGPL library\nMyPlayer, a GPL playback application\nThe binary-only Sorenson decoder\n\n"});
