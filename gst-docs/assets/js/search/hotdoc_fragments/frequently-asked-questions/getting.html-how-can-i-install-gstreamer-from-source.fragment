For example, if you\nconfigured GStreamer with the default prefix (which is /usr/local), then\nyou need to:\nbefore building GStreamer plugin modules. After installing GStreamer from\nsource on Linux, run sudo ldconfig to make sure your new libs will be found.\nPlease note that GStreamer is not an easy thing to build from source, since it\nhas so many interconnected pieces from multiple modules, which must all be\ninstalled just right and must all find each other in the right versions.\nIf you have GStreamer already installed from packages, it is strongly\nrecommended that you find newer packages instead of installing from source, or\nupgrade to a distro version that ships newer packages. Installing from source\ninto one prefix with distro packages in another prefix can cause problems if\nit's not done right, and it is very difficult for anyone to provide help with\nsuch a setup.\n"});
