For this, you\nneed to link the audiotestsrc element to an output element that matches\nyour hardware. A (non-complete) list of output plug-ins for audio is\npulsesink for Pulseaudio output\nalsasink for ALSA output\nosssink and oss4sink for OSS/OSSv4 output\njackaudiosink for JACK output\nautoaudiosink for automatic audio output selection\nFirst of all, run gst-inspect-1.0 on the output plug-in you want to use\nto make sure you have it installed. For example, if you use Pulseaudio,\nrun\nand see if that prints out a bunch of properties for the plug-in.\nThen try to play the sine tone by\nrunning\nand see if you hear something. Make sure your volume is turned up, but\nalso make sure it is not too loud and you are not wearing your\nheadphones.\n\n\npulsesink for Pulseaudio output\n\n\nalsasink for ALSA output\n\n\nosssink and oss4sink for OSS/OSSv4 output\n\n\njackaudiosink for JACK output\n\n\nautoaudiosink for automatic audio output selection\n\n\n"});
