It\nincludes the results of discussions with lawyers, including official\nrepresentatives of the FSF, to help us ensure we cover the legal issues\nas correctly as possible. This does not mean the FSF or anyone else\nendorse the opinions in this page. The opinions only represent the rough\nconsensus of the GStreamer community. The advice contained in here is\nmeant as information and guidance for people developing free and open\nsource software using the GStreamer library, so they are aware of the\nconsequences of their choices. People developing proprietary software or\npeople distributing GStreamer might also find this document useful in\norder to understand how GStreamer works in a licensing context.\nThis text is also meant to explain a little about our thinking in\nregards to how to deal with the problem of software patents which is an\neven bigger pain in the field of multimedia than other fields of\nprogramming.\nFor more information on licensing you can check out our legal\nFAQ\n"});
