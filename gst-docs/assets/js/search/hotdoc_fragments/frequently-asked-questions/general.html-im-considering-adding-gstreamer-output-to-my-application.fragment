GStreamer is not a sound server,\nso you don't output directly to GStreamer, and it's not an intermediate\nAPI between audio data and different kinds of audio sinks. It is a\nfundamental design decision to use GStreamer in your application; there are\nno easy ways of somehow 'transfering' data from your app to GStreamer (well,\nthere are of course, but they would be reserved for special use cases).\nInstead, your application would have to use or implement a number of GStreamer\nelements, string them together, and tell them to run. In that manner the\ndata would all be internal to the GStreamer pipeline.\nThat said, it is possible to write a plugin specific to your app that\ncan get at the audio or video data.\n"});
