By using the work done by others, we both reduce the amount of\nredundant work being done and leave ourselves free to work on the\narchitecture itself instead of working on the low-level stuff. We would\nbe stupid not to reuse the code others have written.\nHowever, do realize that in no way you are forced to have all\ndependencies installed. None of the core developers has all of them\ninstalled. GStreamer has only a few mandatory dependencies : GLib 2.0,\nliborc, and very common stuff like glibc, a C compiler, and so on. All\nother dependencies are optional.\nIn closing, let's rephrase the question to “Why are you giving me so\nmany choices and such a rich environment?”\n"});
