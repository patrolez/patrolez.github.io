Can't I just open a new MR?\nThe script will move existing discussions and comments. This is particularly useful for MRs that have been reviewed already and have open discussion items. This makes sure we don't accidentally merge something even though there were outstanding issues, which we wouldn't know if you just filed a new MR and closed the old Merge Request.\nIf the existing Merge Request has not had any review comments yet or is something simple, there's no problem just opening a new MR against the mono repo and closing the old one instead of course.\n"});
