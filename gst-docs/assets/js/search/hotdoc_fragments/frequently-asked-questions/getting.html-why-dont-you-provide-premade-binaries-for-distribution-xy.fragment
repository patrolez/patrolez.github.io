The packages that are\nprovided are made by non-paid people who do this on their own time. The\ndistributions we support with binaries are the distributions that we\nhave people who have volunteered to make binaries for. If you are\ninterested in maintaining GStreamer binaries for other distributions or\nUnices we would be happy to hear from you. Contact us through the\nGStreamer-devel mailing list.\n"});
