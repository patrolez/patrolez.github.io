Can it be used headless?\nYes, we have no hard dependency on X11 or any other windowing system in\nany of our modules. There are many GStreamer applications that run fine\nwithout any need for display servers or windowing systems,\nfor example streaming servers, transcoding applications, or audio\napplications that don't output any video. Other applications output\nvideo to a framebuffer, custom-made hardware sinks, or via wayland.\n"});
