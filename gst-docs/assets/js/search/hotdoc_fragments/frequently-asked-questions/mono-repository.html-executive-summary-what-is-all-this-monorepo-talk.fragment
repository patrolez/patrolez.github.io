It would also provide a development environment that made it easy to work on GStreamer and use or test versions other than the system-installed GStreamer version.\nAll of these modules have now (as of 28 September 2021) been merged into a single git repository (\"Mono repository\" or \"monorepo\") which should simplify development workflows and continuous integration, especially where changes need to be made to multiple modules at once.\nThis mono repository merge will primarily affect GStreamer developers and contributors and anyone who has workflows based on the GStreamer git repositories.\nThe Rust bindings and Rust plugins modules have not been merged into the mono repository at this time because they follow a different release cycle.\nThe mono repository lives in the existing GStreamer core git repository in the new \"main\" branch and all future development will happen on this \"main\" branch.\n"});
