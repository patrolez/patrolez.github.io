What do I do?\nWell, start by checking if you really are missing the plug-in.\nand replace (plug-in) with the plug-in you think is missing. If this\ndoesn't return any result, then you either don't have it or it can't be\nfound (which can easily happen if you have installed things from source).\nIf you're not sure either way, then chances are good that you don't have\nit. You should get the plug-in and restart the application. How\nto get the plug-in depends on your distribution. Many applications\nand distributions nowadays support automatic plugin installation of\nmissing plugins. Mayb also try playing your file with a different application\nif your application does not support installation of missing plugins.\nif you run GStreamer using packages for your distribution, you\nshould check what packages are available for your distribution and\nsee if any of the available packages contains the plug-in. Make sure\nyou have the common plugin packages installed, such as gst-plugins-base,\ngst-plugins-good, gst-plugins-ugly, gst-plugins-bad, and gst-libav.\nif you run GStreamer from a source install, there's a good chance\nthe plug-in didn't get built because you are missing an external\nlibrary. When you ran configure, you should have gotten output of\nwhat plug-ins are going to be built. You can re-run configure to see\nif it's there. If it isn't, there is a good reason why it is not\ngetting built. The most likely is that you're missing the library\nyou need for it. Check the README file in gst-plugins to see what\nlibrary you need. Make sure to remember to re-run configure after\ninstalling the supporting library !\nif you run GStreamer from git, the same logic applies as for a\nsource install. Go over the reasons why the plug-in didn't get\nconfigured for build. Check output of config.log for a clue as to\nwhy it doesn't get built if you're sure you have the library needed\ninstalled in a sane place.\n\n\nif you run GStreamer using packages for your distribution, you\nshould check what packages are available for your distribution and\nsee if any of the available packages contains the plug-in.
