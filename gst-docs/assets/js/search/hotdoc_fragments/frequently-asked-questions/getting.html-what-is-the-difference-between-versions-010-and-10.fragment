What's up with that?\nGStreamer-0.10 and GStreamer-1.0 are the main version 'series'\ncurrently in use. For all practical purposes you should think of them as\ntwo completely different libraries which just happen to have a similar\nname. They can be installed in parallel and are completely independent.\nGStreamer 1.x has been the main stable series since 2012. GStreamer 0.10 is\nno longer maintained.\nFor the 0.10 version you will need the 0.10 plugins and bindings\n(gst-plugins 0.10.x, gst-ffmpeg 0.10.x, gst-python 0.10.x etc.), while\nfor the 1.0 version you will need the 1.0 plugins and bindings (ie.\ngst-plugins-base 1.0.x, gst-plugins-good 1.0.x, gst-plugins-ugly 1.0.x,\ngst-plugins-bad 1.0.x, gst-ffmpeg 1.0.x, gst-python 1.0.x). The micro\nversion for each main version does not have to match exactly, only the\nmajor versions needs to be the same (ie. it may be that the current\ngst-plugins-good version is 1.0.6 and the current GStreamer core version\nis 1.0.13). GStreamer-1.0 will not see or use any of the GStreamer-0.10\nplugins and vice versa.\nAll GStreamer command line tools are suffixed with their main version,\ne.g. gst-launch-1.0 and gst-inspect-1.0.\nApplications will use either GStreamer-1.0 or GStreamer-0.10, since the\n1.0 and 0.10 API/ABI are not compatible.\nOdd-numbered versions such as 0.9.x, 0.11.x, 1.3.x, 1.5.x, 1.7.x etc. are\nunstable developer releases that should generally not be used.\n"});
