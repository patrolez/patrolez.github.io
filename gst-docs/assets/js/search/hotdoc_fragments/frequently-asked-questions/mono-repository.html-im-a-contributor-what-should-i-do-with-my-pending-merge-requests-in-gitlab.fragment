If you already have a checkout, you may need to switch to the main branch.\nWith this script you'll be able to move any open MRs of yours in the various GStreamer modules to the gstreamer mono repository.\nThe script will keep the discussion history and link to the previous MRs.\nThe script will also check that there is no existing MR already to avoid duplication.\nBefore you can run the script, you first need to go to your profile page in GitLab to generate a gitlab access token:\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/-/profile/personal_access_tokens\nOn this page you'll need to give a token name, grant access\nto (API, read_user, read_api) and then press the create personal access token button.\nYou should see a value in the token name edit box. The name is just for you, you can call it anything you like (e.g. \"scripts\").\n\nWhen you have a token such as \"edEFoqK3tATMj-XD6pY_\" you should be able to access the gitlab API and run the script:\nIn case you have several merge requests, you can run it with just one merge request first, e.g. if the initial merge request you want to move for testing purposes is\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-base/-/merge_requests/1277\nyou can run:\nWhen you are ready, you can also run the same script without any parameters to browse and move all your Merge Requests:\nDon't worry - the script will prompt you for input along the way before it does anything.\n"});
