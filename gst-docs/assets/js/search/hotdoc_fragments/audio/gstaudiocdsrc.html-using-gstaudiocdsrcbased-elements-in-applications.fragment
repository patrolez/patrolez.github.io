Applications will usually\nonly find the \"track\" format interesting. You can retrieve that GstFormat\nfor use in seek events or queries with gst_format_get_by_nick(\"track\").\nIn order to query the number of tracks, for example, an application would\nset the CDDA source element to READY or PAUSED state and then query the\nthe number of tracks via gst_element_query_duration using the track\nformat acquired above. Applications can query the currently playing track\nin the same way.\nAlternatively, applications may retrieve the currently playing track and\nthe total number of tracks from the taglist that will posted on the bus\nwhenever the CD is opened or the currently playing track changes. The\ntaglist will contain GST_TAG_TRACK_NUMBER and GST_TAG_TRACK_COUNT tags.\nApplications playing back CD audio using playbin and cdda://n URIs should\nissue a seek command in track format to change between tracks, rather than\nsetting a new cdda://n+1 URI on playbin (as setting a new URI on playbin\ninvolves closing and re-opening the CD device, which is much much slower).\n"});
