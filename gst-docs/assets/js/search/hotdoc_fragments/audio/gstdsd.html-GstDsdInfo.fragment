Unlike PCM, there are no further\n\"sample formats\" in DSD. However, in software, DSD bits are grouped into\nbytes (since dealing with individual bits is impractical), and these bytes\nin turn are grouped into words. This becomes relevant when interleaving\nchannels and transmitting DSD data through audio APIs. The different\ntypes of grouping DSD bytes are referred to as the \"DSD grouping forma\"\nor just \"DSD format\". GstDsdFormat has a list of valid ways of grouping\nDSD bytes into words.\nDSD rates are equivalent to PCM sample rates, except that they specify\nhow many DSD bytes are consumed per second. This refers to the bytes per\nsecond per channel; the rate does not change when the number of channel\nchanges. (Strictly speaking, it would be more correct to measure the\nbits per second, since the bit is the DSD \"sample format\", but it is\nmore practical to use bytes.) In DSD, bit rates are always an integer\nmultiple of the CD audio rate (44100) or the DAT rate (48000). DSD64-44x\nis 44100 * 64 = 2822400 bits per second, or 352800 bytes per second\n(the latter would be used in this info structure). DSD64-48x is\n48000 * 64 = 3072000 bits per second, or 384000 bytes per second.\nGST_DSD_MAKE_DSD_RATE_44x can be used for specifying DSD-44x rates,\n*and GST_DSD_MAKE_DSD_RATE_48x can be used for specifying DSD-48x ones.\nAlso, since DSD-48x is less well known, when the multiplier is given\nwithout the 44x/48x specifier, 44x is typically implied.\nIt is important to know that in DSD, different format widths correspond\nto different playtimes. That is, a word with 32 DSD bits covers two times\nas much playtime as a word with 16 DSD bits. This is in contrast to PCM,\nwhere one word (= one PCM sample) always covers a time period of 1/samplerate,\nno matter how many bits a PCM sample is made of. For this reason, DSD\nand PCM widths and strides cannot be used the same way.\nMultiple channels are arranged in DSD data either interleaved or non-\ninterleaved. This is similar to PCM. Interleaved layouts rotate between\nchannels and words. First, word 0 of channel 0 is present. Then word\n0 of channel 1 follows. Then word 0 of channel 2 etc. until all\nchannels are through, then comes word 1 of channel 0 etc.\nNon-interleaved data is planar. First, all words of channel 0 are\npresent, then all words of channel 1 etc. Unlike interleaved data,\nnon-interleaved data can be sparse, that is, there can be space in\nbetween the planes. the positions array specifies the plane offsets.\nIn uncommon cases, the DSD bits in the data bytes can be stored in reverse\norder. For example, normally, in DSDU8, the first byte contains DSD bits\n0 to 7, and the most significant bit of that byte is DSD bit 0. If this\norder is reversed, then bit 7 is the first one instead. In that ase,\nreversed_bytes is set to TRUE.\nUse the provided macros to access the info in this structure.\nDSD grouping format\nDSD rate\nnumber of channels (must be at least 1)\naudio layout\ntrue if the DSD bits in the data bytes are reversed,\nthat is, the least significant bit comes first\npositions for each channel\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.24\n\t\t\nInformation describing DSD audio properties.\nIn DSD, the \"sample format\" is the bit.
