Also, elements deriving from\nGstAudioFilter may use gst_audio_filter_class_add_pad_templates from\ntheir class_init function to easily configure the set of caps/formats that\nthe element is able to handle.\nDerived classes should override the setup() and\ntransform_ip() and/or\ntransform()\nvirtual functions in their class_init function.\n"});
