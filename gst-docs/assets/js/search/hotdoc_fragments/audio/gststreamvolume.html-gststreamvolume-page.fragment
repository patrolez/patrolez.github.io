fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"audio/gststreamvolume.html#gststreamvolume-page","fragment":"GstStreamVolume\nThis interface is implemented by elements that provide a stream volume. Examples for\nsuch elements are volume and playbin.\nApplications can use this interface to get or set the current stream volume. For this\nthe \"volume\" GObject property can be used or the helper functions gst_stream_volume_set_volume\nand gst_stream_volume_get_volume. This volume is always a linear factor, i.e. 0.0 is muted\n1.0 is 100%. For showing the volume in a GUI it might make sense to convert it to\na different format by using gst_stream_volume_convert_volume. Volume sliders should usually\nuse a cubic volume.\nSeparate from the volume the stream can also be muted by the \"mute\" GObject property or\ngst_stream_volume_set_mute and gst_stream_volume_get_mute.\nElements that provide some kind of stream volume should implement the \"volume\" and\n\"mute\" GObject properties and handle setting and getting of them properly.\nThe volume property is defined to be a linear volume factor.\n"});
