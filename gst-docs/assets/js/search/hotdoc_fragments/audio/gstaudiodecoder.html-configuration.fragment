fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"audio/gstaudiodecoder.html#configuration","fragment":"Configuration\nAs of configuration stage, and throughout processing, GstAudioDecoder\nprovides various (context) parameters, e.g. describing the format of\noutput audio data (valid when output caps have been set) or current parsing state.\nConversely, subclass can and should configure context to inform\nbase class of its expectation w.r.t. buffer handling.\n\nInitially, GstAudioDecoder calls start when the decoder element\nis activated, which allows subclass to perform any global setup.\nBase class (context) parameters can already be set according to subclass\ncapabilities (or possibly upon receive more information in subsequent\nset_format).\nGstAudioDecoder calls set_format to inform subclass of the format\nof input audio data that it is about to receive.\nWhile unlikely, it might be called more than once, if changing input\nparameters require reconfiguration.\nGstAudioDecoder calls stop at end of all processing.\n\n"});
