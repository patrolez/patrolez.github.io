This\nfeatures allows wpevideosrc to be used on machines without GPU, and/or for testing\npurpose. To enable it, set the LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true environment\nvariable and make sure video/x-raw, format=BGRA caps are negotiated by the\nwpevideosrc element.\nAs the webview loading is usually not instantaneous, the wpevideosrc element emits\nmessages indicating the load progress, in percent. The value is an estimate\nbased on the total number of bytes expected to be received for a document,\nincluding all its possible subresources and child documents. The application\ncan handle these element messages synchronously for instance, in order to\ndisplay a progress bar or other visual load indicator. The load percent value\nis stored in the message structure as a double value named\nestimated-load-progress and the structure name is wpe-stats.\n"});
