For that to happen the\napplication needs to make the source stop recording and send an EOS\nevent down the pipeline. The application would then wait for an\nEOS message posted on the pipeline's bus to know when all data has\nbeen processed and the pipeline can safely be stopped.\nAn application may send an EOS event to a source element to make it\nperform the EOS logic (send EOS event downstream or post a\nGST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE on the bus). This can typically be done\nwith the gst_element_send_event function on the element or its parent bin.\nAfter the EOS has been sent to the element, the application should wait for\nan EOS message to be posted on the pipeline's bus. Once this EOS message is\nreceived, it may safely shut down the entire pipeline.\n"});
