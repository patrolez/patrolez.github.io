Elements\nthat are suitable for implementation using GstBaseTransform are ones\nwhere the size and caps of the output is known entirely from the input\ncaps and buffer sizes. These include elements that directly transform\none buffer into another, modify the contents of a buffer in-place, as\nwell as elements that collate multiple input buffers into one output buffer,\nor that expand one input buffer into multiple output buffers.
