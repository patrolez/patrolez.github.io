All rendered buffers and events will be put in a queue so that the application\ncan pull them at its own rate. Note that when the application does not\npull samples fast enough, the queued buffers could consume a lot of memory,\nespecially when dealing with raw video frames.\nEvents can be pulled when the appsink is in the READY, PAUSED or PLAYING state.\nThis function will only pull serialized events, excluding\nthe EOS event for which this functions returns\nNULL. Use gst_app_sink_is_eos to check for the EOS condition.\nThis method is a variant of gst_app_sink_pull_sample that can be used\nto handle incoming events events as well as samples.\nNote that future releases may extend this API to return other object types\nso make sure that your code is checking for the actual type it is handling.\nParameters:\na GstAppSink\na GstSample, or a GstEvent or NULL when the appsink is stopped or EOS.\nCall gst_mini_object_unref after usage.\n\n\tSince\t\t\t: 1.20\n\t\t\n"});
