The squares have a width and height of\nrespectively pattern-width and pattern-height.\nEven squares must be black and odd squares must be white.\nWhen the pattern has been found, pattern-data-count squares\nafter the pattern squares are read as a bitarray. White squares represent a 1\nbit and black squares a 0 bit. The bitarray will will included in the element\nmessage that is posted (see below).\nAfter the pattern has been found and the data pattern has been read, an\nelement message called GstSimpleVideoMarkDetect will\nbe posted on the bus. If the pattern is no longer found in the frame, the\nsame element message is posted with the have-pattern field set to FALSE.\nThe message is only posted if the message property is TRUE.\nThe message's structure contains these fields:\ngbooleanhave-pattern: if the pattern was found. This field will be set to TRUE for as long as\nthe pattern was found in the frame and set to FALSE for the first frame\nthat does not contain the pattern anymore.\nGstClockTime timestamp: the timestamp of the buffer that triggered the message.\nGstClockTime stream-time: the stream time of the buffer.\nGstClockTime running-time: the running_time of the buffer.\nGstClockTime duration: the duration of the buffer.\nguint64 data: the data-pattern found after the pattern or 0 when have-signal is FALSE.\n\n\ngbooleanhave-pattern: if the pattern was found.
