The squares have a width and height of\nrespectively pattern-width and pattern-height.\nEven squares will be black and odd squares will be white.\nAfter writing the pattern, pattern-data-count squares after the\npattern squares are produced as the bitarray given in\npattern-data. 1 bits will produce white squares and 0 bits will\nproduce black squares.\nThe element can be enabled with the enabled property. It is\nmostly used together with the simplevideomarkdetect plugin.\n"});
