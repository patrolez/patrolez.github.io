For each of the requested\nsink pads it will compare the incoming geometry and framerate to define the\noutput parameters. Indeed output video frames will have the geometry of the\nbiggest incoming video stream and the framerate of the fastest incoming one.\nCompositor will do colorspace conversion.\nIndividual parameters for each input stream can be configured on the\nGstCompositorPad:\n\n\"xpos\": The x-coordinate position of the top-left corner of the picture (#gint)\n\"ypos\": The y-coordinate position of the top-left corner of the picture (#gint)\n\"width\": The width of the picture; the input will be scaled if necessary (#gint)\n\"height\": The height of the picture; the input will be scaled if necessary (#gint)\n\"alpha\": The transparency of the picture; between 0.0 and 1.0.
