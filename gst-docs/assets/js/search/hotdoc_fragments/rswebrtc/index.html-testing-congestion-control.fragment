Client web browser has to be launched\non a separate machine on the LAN to test for congestion, although specific\nconfigurations may allow to run it on the same machine.\nTesting procedure was:\nidentify the server machine network interface (e.g. with ifconfig on Linux)\nidentify the client machine IP address (e.g. with ifconfig on Linux)\nstart the various services as explained in the Usage section (use\nGST_DEBUG=webrtcsink:7 to get detailed logs about congestion control)\nstart playback in the client browser\nRun a comcast command on the server machine, for instance:\nObserve the bitrate sharply decreasing, playback should slow down briefly\nthen catch back up\nRemove the bandwidth limitation, and observe the bitrate eventually increasing\nback to a maximum:\nFor comparison, the congestion control property can be set to \"disabled\" on\nwebrtcsink, then the above procedure applied again, the expected result is\nfor playback to simply crawl down to a halt until the bandwidth limitation\nis lifted:\n\n\nidentify the server machine network interface (e.g. with ifconfig on Linux)\n\n\nidentify the client machine IP address (e.g. with ifconfig on Linux)\n\n\nstart the various services as explained in the Usage section (use\nGST_DEBUG=webrtcsink:7 to get detailed logs about congestion control)\n\n\nstart playback in the client browser\n\n\nRun a comcast command on the server machine, for instance:\n$HOME/go/bin/comcast --device=$SERVER_INTERFACE --target-bw 3000 --target-addr=$CLIENT_IP --target-port=1:65535 --target-proto=udp\n\n\n\nObserve the bitrate sharply decreasing, playback should slow down briefly\nthen catch back up\n\n\nRemove the bandwidth limitation, and observe the bitrate eventually increasing\nback to a maximum:\n$HOME/go/bin/comcast --device=$SERVER_INTERFACE --stop\n\n\n\n"});
