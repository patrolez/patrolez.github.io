Unlike the old hlssink which took a muxed\nMPEG-TS stream as input, this element takes elementary audio and video\nstreams as input and handles the muxing internally. This allows hlssink2\nto make better decisions as to when to start a new fragment and also works\nbetter with input streams where there isn't an encoder element upstream\nthat can generate keyframes on demand as needed.\nThis element only writes fragments and a playlist file into a specified\ndirectory, it does not contain an actual HTTP server to serve these files.\nJust point an external webserver to the directory with the playlist and\nfragment files.\n"});
