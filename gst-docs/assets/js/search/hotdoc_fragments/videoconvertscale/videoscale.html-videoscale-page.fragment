By default the element will try to\nnegotiate to the same size on the source and sinkpad so that no scaling\nis needed. It is therefore safe to insert this element in a pipeline to\nget more robust behaviour without any cost if no scaling is needed.\nThis element supports a wide range of color spaces including various YUV and\nRGB formats and is therefore generally able to operate anywhere in a\npipeline.\n"});
