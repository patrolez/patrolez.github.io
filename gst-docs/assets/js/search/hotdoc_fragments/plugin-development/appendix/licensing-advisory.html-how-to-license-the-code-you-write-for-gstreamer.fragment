The\nreason for this choice in licensing is to ensure that everyone can use\nGStreamer to build applications using licenses of their choice.\nTo keep this policy viable, the GStreamer community has made a few\nlicensing rules for code to be included in GStreamer's core or\nGStreamer's official modules, like our plugin packages. We require that\nall code going into our core package is LGPL. For the plugin code, we\nrequire the use of the LGPL for all plugins written from scratch or\nlinking to external libraries. The only exception to this is when\nplugins contain older code under more liberal licenses (like the MPL or\nBSD). They can use those licenses instead and will still be considered\nfor inclusion. We do not accept GPL code to be added to our plugins\nmodule, but we do accept LGPL-licensed plugins using an external GPL\nlibrary. The reason for demanding plugins be licensed under the LGPL,\neven when using a GPL library, is that other developers might want to\nuse the plugin code as a template for plugins linking to non-GPL\nlibraries.\nWe also plan on splitting out the plugins using GPL libraries into a\nseparate package eventually and implement a system which makes sure an\napplication will not be able to access these plugins unless it uses some\nspecial code to do so. The point of this is not to block GPL-licensed\nplugins from being used and developed, but to make sure people are not\nunintentionally violating the GPL license of said plugins.\nThis advisory is part of a bigger advisory with a FAQ which you can find\non the GStreamer\nwebsite\n"});
