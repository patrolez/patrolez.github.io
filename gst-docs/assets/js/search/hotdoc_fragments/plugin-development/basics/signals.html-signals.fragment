Note, however, that the application needs to be aware of\nsignals and their meaning, so if you're looking for a generic way for\napplication-element interaction, signals are probably not what you're\nlooking for. In many cases, however, signals can be very useful. See the\nGObject documentation\nfor all internals about signals.\n"});
