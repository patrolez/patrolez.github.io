Events\ncan travel both upstream and downstream, so you can receive them on sink\npads as well as source pads.\nBelow follows a very simple event function that we install on the sink\npad of our element.\nIt is a good idea to call the default event handler\ngst_pad_event_default () for unknown events. Depending on the event\ntype, the default handler will forward the event or simply unref it. The\nCAPS event is by default not forwarded so we need to do this in the\nevent handler ourselves.\n"});
