fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/basics/boiler.html#the-plugin_init-function","fragment":"The plugin_init function\nOnce we have written code defining all the parts of the plugin, we need\nto write the plugin_init() function. This is a special function, which\nis called as soon as the plugin is loaded, and should return TRUE or\nFALSE depending on whether it loaded initialized any dependencies\ncorrectly. Also, in this function, any supported element type in the\nplugin should be registered.\nNote that the information returned by the plugin_init() function will\nbe cached in a central registry. For this reason, it is important that\nthe same information is always returned by the function: for example, it\nmust not make element factories available based on runtime conditions.\nIf an element can only work in certain conditions (for example, if the\nsoundcard is not being used by some other process) this must be\nreflected by the element being unable to enter the READY state if\nunavailable, rather than the plugin attempting to deny existence of the\nplugin.\n"});
