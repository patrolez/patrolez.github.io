These details are collectively\nknown as the boilerplate.\nThe standard way of defining the boilerplate is simply to write some\ncode, and fill in some structures. As mentioned in the previous section,\nthe easiest way to do this is to copy a template and add functionality\naccording to your needs. To help you do so, there is a tool in the\n./gst-plugin/tools/ directory. This tool, make_element, is a command\nline utility that creates the boilerplate code for you.\nTo use make_element, first open up a terminal window. Change to the\ngst-template/gst-plugin/src directory, and then run the make_element\ncommand. The arguments to the make_element are:\nthe name of the plugin, and\nthe source file that the tool will use. By default, gstplugin is\nused.\nFor example, the following commands create the MyFilter plugin based on\nthe plugin template and put the output files in the\ngst-template/gst-plugin/src directory:\nNote\nCapitalization is important for the name of the plugin. Keep in mind\nthat under some operating systems, capitalization is also important\nwhen specifying directory and file names in general.\nThe last command creates two files: gstmyfilter.c and gstmyfilter.h.\nNote\nIt is recommended that you create a copy of the gst-plugin directory\nbefore continuing.\nNow one needs to run meson build from the parent directory to bootstrap the\nbuild environment. After that, the project can be built and installed using the\nwell known ninja -C build commands.\nNote\nBe aware that by default meson will choose /usr/local as a default\nlocation. One would need to add /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 to\nGST_PLUGIN_PATH in order to make the new plugin show up in a gstreamer\nthat's been installed from packages.\nNote\nFIXME: this section is slightly outdated. gst-template is still useful\nas an example for a minimal plugin build system skeleton. However, for\ncreating elements the tool gst-element-maker from gst-plugins-bad is\nrecommended these days.\n"});
