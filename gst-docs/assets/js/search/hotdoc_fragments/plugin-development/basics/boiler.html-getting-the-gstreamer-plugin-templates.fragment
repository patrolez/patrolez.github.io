The second method is by far\nthe simpler of the two, so the first method will not even be described\nhere. (Errm, that is, “it is left as an exercise to the reader.”)\nThe first step is to check out a copy of the gst-template git module\nto get an important tool and the source code template for a basic\nGStreamer plugin. To check out the gst-template module, make sure you\nare connected to the internet, and type the following commands at a\ncommand\nconsole:\nThis command will check out a series of files and directories into\ngst-template. The template you will be using is in the\ngst-template/gst-plugin/ directory. You should look over the files in\nthat directory to get a general idea of the structure of a source tree\nfor a plugin.\nIf for some reason you can't access the git repository, you can also\ndownload a snapshot of the latest\nrevision\nvia the gitlab web interface.\n"});
