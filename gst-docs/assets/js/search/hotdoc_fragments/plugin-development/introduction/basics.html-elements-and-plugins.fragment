In the context of plugin\ndevelopment, an element is an object derived from the GstElement class. Elements\nprovide some sort of functionality when linked with other elements: For\nexample, a source element provides data to a stream, and a filter\nelement acts on the data in a stream. Without elements, GStreamer is\njust a bunch of conceptual pipe fittings with nothing to link. A large\nnumber of elements ship with GStreamer, but extra elements can also be\nwritten.\nJust writing a new element is not entirely enough, however: You will\nneed to encapsulate your element in a plugin to enable GStreamer to\nuse it. A plugin is essentially a loadable block of code, usually called\na shared object file or a dynamically linked library. A single plugin\nmay contain the implementation of several elements, or just a single\none. For simplicity, this guide concentrates primarily on plugins\ncontaining one element.\nA filter is an important type of element that processes a stream of\ndata. Producers and consumers of data are called source and sink\nelements, respectively. Bin elements contain other elements. One type\nof bin is responsible for synchronization of the elements that they\ncontain so that data flows smoothly. Another type of bin, called\nautoplugger elements, automatically add other elements to the bin and\nlinks them together so that they act as a filter between two arbitrary\nstream types.\nThe plugin mechanism is used everywhere in GStreamer, even if only the\nstandard packages are being used. A few very basic functions reside in\nthe core library, and all others are implemented in plugins. A plugin\nregistry is used to store the details of the plugins in a binary\nregistry file. This way, a program using GStreamer does not have to load\nall plugins to determine which are needed. Plugins are only loaded when\ntheir provided elements are requested.\nSee the GStreamer Library Reference for the current implementation\ndetails of GstElement and GstPlugin.\n"});
