A pad can be viewed as a “place” or “port” on an element\nwhere links may be made with other elements, and through which data can\nflow to or from those elements. Pads have specific data handling\ncapabilities: A pad can restrict the type of data that flows through it.\nLinks are only allowed between two pads when the allowed data types of\nthe two pads are compatible.\nAn analogy may be helpful here. A pad is similar to a plug or jack on a\nphysical device. Consider, for example, a home theater system consisting\nof an amplifier, a DVD player, and a (silent) video projector. Linking\nthe DVD player to the amplifier is allowed because both devices have\naudio jacks, and linking the projector to the DVD player is allowed\nbecause both devices have compatible video jacks. Links between the\nprojector and the amplifier may not be made because the projector and\namplifier have different types of jacks. Pads in GStreamer serve the\nsame purpose as the jacks in the home theater system.\nFor the most part, all data in GStreamer flows one way through a link\nbetween elements. Data flows out of one element through one or more\nsource pads, and elements accept incoming data through one or more\nsink pads. Source and sink elements have only source and sink pads,\nrespectively.\nSee the GStreamer Library Reference for the current implementation\ndetails of a GstPad.\n"});
