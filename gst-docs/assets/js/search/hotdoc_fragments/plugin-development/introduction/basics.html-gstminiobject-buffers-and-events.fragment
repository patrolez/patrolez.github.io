GstMiniObject is the structure used to hold these chunks of\ndata.\nGstMiniObject contains the following important types:\nAn exact type indicating what type of data (event, buffer, ...) this\nGstMiniObject is.\nA reference count indicating the number of elements currently\nholding a reference to the miniobject. When the reference count\nfalls to zero, the miniobject will be disposed, and its memory will\nbe freed in some sense (see below for more details).\nFor data transport, there are two types of GstMiniObject defined: events\n(control) and buffers (content).\nBuffers may contain any sort of data that the two linked pads know how\nto handle. Normally, a buffer contains a chunk of some sort of audio or\nvideo data that flows from one element to another.\nBuffers also contain metadata describing the buffer's contents. Some of\nthe important types of metadata are:\nPointers to one or more GstMemory objects. GstMemory objects are\nrefcounted objects that encapsulate a region of memory.\nA timestamp indicating the preferred display timestamp of the\ncontent in the buffer.\nEvents contain information on the state of the stream flowing between\nthe two linked pads. Events will only be sent if the element explicitly\nsupports them, else the core will (try to) handle the events\nautomatically. Events are used to indicate, for example, a media type,\nthe end of a media stream or that the cache should be flushed.\nEvents may contain several of the following items:\nA subtype indicating the type of the contained event.\nThe other contents of the event depend on the specific event type.\nEvents will be discussed extensively in Events: Seeking, Navigation and\nMore. Until then, the only event that\nwill be used is the EOS event, which is used to indicate the end-of-stream\n(usually end-of-file).\nSee the GStreamer Library Reference for the current implementation\ndetails of a GstMiniObject, GstBuffer\nand GstEvent.\n\n\nAn exact type indicating what type of data (event, buffer, ...) this\nGstMiniObject is.\n\n\nA reference count indicating the number of elements currently\nholding a reference to the miniobject.
