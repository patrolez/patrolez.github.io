The guide is\nrelevant to several groups of people:\nAnyone who wants to add support for new ways of processing data in\nGStreamer. For example, a person in this group might want to create\na new data format converter, a new visualization tool, or a new\ndecoder or encoder.\nAnyone who wants to add support for new input and output devices.\nFor example, people in this group might want to add the ability to\nwrite to a new video output system or read data from a digital\ncamera or special microphone.\nAnyone who wants to extend GStreamer in any way. You need to have an\nunderstanding of how the plugin system works before you can\nunderstand the constraints that the plugin system places on the rest\nof the code. Also, you might be surprised after reading this at how\nmuch can be done with plugins.\nThis guide is not relevant to you if you only want to use the existing\nfunctionality of GStreamer, or if you just want to use an application\nthat uses GStreamer. If you are only interested in using existing\nplugins to write a new application - and there are quite a lot of\nplugins already - you might want to check the GStreamer Application\nDevelopment Manual. If you are just trying to get help with a GStreamer\napplication, then you should check with the user manual for that\nparticular application.\n\n\nAnyone who wants to add support for new ways of processing data in\nGStreamer.
