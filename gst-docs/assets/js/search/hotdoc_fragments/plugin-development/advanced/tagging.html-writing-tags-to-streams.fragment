fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/tagging.html#writing-tags-to-streams","fragment":"Writing Tags to Streams\nTag writers are the opposite of tag readers. Tag writers only take\nmetadata tags into account, since that's the only type of tags that have\nto be written into a stream. Tag writers can receive tags in three ways:\ninternal, application and pipeline. Internal tags are tags read by the\nelement itself, which means that the tag writer is - in that case - a\ntag reader, too. Application tags are tags provided to the element via\nthe TagSetter interface (which is just a layer). Pipeline tags are tags\nprovided to the element from within the pipeline. The element receives\nsuch tags via the GST_EVENT_TAG event, which means that tags writers\nshould implement an event handler. The tag writer is responsible for\ncombining all these three into one list and writing them to the output\nstream.\nThe example below will receive tags from both application and pipeline,\ncombine them and write them to the output stream. It implements the tag\nsetter so applications can set tags, and retrieves pipeline tags from\nincoming events.\nWarning, this example is outdated and doesn't work with the 1.0 version\nof GStreamer anymore.\nNote that normally elements would not read the full stream before\nprocessing tags. Rather, they would read from each sinkpad until they've\nreceived data (since tags usually come in before the first data buffer)\nand process that.\n"});
