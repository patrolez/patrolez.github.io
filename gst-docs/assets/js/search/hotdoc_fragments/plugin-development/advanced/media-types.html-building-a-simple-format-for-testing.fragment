A media\ntype would ideally be equivalent to the Mime-type defined by IANA; else,\nit should be in the form type/x-name, where type is the sort of data\nthis media type handles (audio, video, ...) and name should be something\nspecific for this specific type. Audio and video media types should try\nto support the general audio/video properties (see the list), and can\nuse their own properties, too. To get an idea of what properties we\nthink are useful, see (again) the list.\nTake your time to find the right set of properties for your type. There\nis no reason to hurry. Also, experimenting with this is generally a good\nidea. Experience learns that theoretically thought-out types are good,\nbut they still need practical use to assure that they serve their needs.\nMake sure that your property names do not clash with similar properties\nused in other types. If they match, make sure they mean the same thing;\nproperties with different types but the same names are not allowed.\n"});
