In throttle mode, the time distance\nbetween buffers is kept to a configurable throttle interval. This means\nthat effectively the buffer rate is limited to 1 buffer per throttle\ninterval. This can be used to limit the framerate, for example.\nWhen an element is configured in throttling mode (this is usually only\nimplemented on sinks) it should produce QoS events upstream with the\njitter field set to the throttle interval. This should instruct upstream\nelements to skip or drop the remaining buffers in the configured\nthrottle interval.\nThe proportion field is set to the desired slowdown needed to get the\ndesired throttle interval. Implementations can use the QoS Throttle\ntype, the proportion and the jitter member to tune their\nimplementations.\nThe default sink base class, has the “throttle-time” property for this\nfeature. You can test this with: gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! xvimagesink throttle-time=500000000\n"});
