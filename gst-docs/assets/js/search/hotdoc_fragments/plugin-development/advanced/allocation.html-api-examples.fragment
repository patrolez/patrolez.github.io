You can alternatively use the convenience function\ngst_buffer_new_allocate () to perform both operations at once. It's also possible\nto wrap existing memory with gst_buffer_new_wrapped_full () and specify the\nfunction to call when the memory should be freed.\nYou can access the memory of a GstBuffer by getting and mapping the\nGstMemory objects individually or by using gst_buffer_map (). The\nlatter merges all the memory into one big block and then gives you a\npointer to it.\nBelow is an example of how to create a buffer and access its memory.\n"});
