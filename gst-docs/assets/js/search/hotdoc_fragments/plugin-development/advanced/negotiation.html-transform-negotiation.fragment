fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/negotiation.html#transform-negotiation","fragment":"Transform negotiation\nIn this negotiation technique, there is a fixed transform between the\nelement input caps and the output caps. This transformation could be\nparameterized by element properties but not by the content of the stream\n(see Fixed negotiation for that use-case).\nThe caps that the element can accept depend on the (fixed\ntransformation) downstream caps. The caps that the element can produce\ndepend on the (fixed transformation of) the upstream caps.\nThis type of element can usually set caps on its source pad from the\n_event() function on the sink pad when it received the CAPS event.\nThis means that the caps transform function transforms a fixed caps into\nanother fixed caps. Examples of elements include:\nVideobox. It adds configurable border around a video frame depending\non object properties.\nIdentity elements. All elements that don't change the format of the\ndata, only the content. Video and audio effects are an example.\nOther examples include elements that inspect the stream.\nSome decoders and encoders, where the output format is defined by\ninput format, like mulawdec and mulawenc. These decoders usually\nhave no headers that define the content of the stream. They are\nusually more like conversion elements.\nBelow is an example of a negotiation steps of a typical transform\nelement. In the sink pad CAPS event handler, we compute the caps for the\nsource pad and set those.\n\n\nVideobox.
