Negotiation of the allocation strategy\nis always initiated and decided by a srcpad after it has negotiated a\nformat and before it decides to push buffers. A sinkpad can suggest an\nallocation strategy but it is ultimately the source pad that will decide\nbased on the suggestions of the downstream sink pad.\nThe source pad will do a GST_QUERY_ALLOCATION with the negotiated caps\nas a parameter. This is needed so that the downstream element knows what\nmedia type is being handled. A downstream sink pad can answer the\nallocation query with the following results:\nAn array of possible GstBufferPool suggestions with suggested\nsize, minimum and maximum amount of buffers.\nAn array of GstAllocator objects along with suggested allocation\nparameters such as flags, prefix, alignment and padding. These\nallocators can also be configured in a bufferpool when this is\nsupported by the bufferpool.\nAn array of supported GstMeta implementations along with metadata\nspecific parameters. It is important that the upstream element knows\nwhat kind of metadata is supported downstream before it places that\nmetadata on buffers.\nWhen the GST_QUERY_ALLOCATION returns, the source pad will select from\nthe available bufferpools, allocators and metadata how it will allocate\nbuffers.\n\n\nAn array of possible GstBufferPool suggestions with suggested\nsize, minimum and maximum amount of buffers.\n\n\nAn array of GstAllocator objects along with suggested allocation\nparameters such as flags, prefix, alignment and padding.
