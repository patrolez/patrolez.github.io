We can\nidentify 3 caps negotiation use cases for the source pads:\nFixed negotiation. An element can output one format only. See Fixed\nnegotiation.\nTransform negotiation. There is a (fixed) transform between the\ninput and output format of the element, usually based on some\nelement property. The caps that the element will produce depend on\nthe upstream caps and the caps that the element can accept depend on\nthe downstream caps. See Transform\nnegotiation.\nDynamic negotiation. An element can output many formats. See\nDynamic negotiation.\n\n\nFixed negotiation. An element can output one format only. See Fixed\nnegotiation.\n\n\nTransform negotiation.
