The real-time performance is always\nmeasured relative to the pipeline clock and typically happens in the\nsinks when they synchronize buffers against the clock.\nWhen buffers arrive late in the sink, i.e. when their running-time is\nsmaller than that of the clock, we say that the pipeline is having a\nquality of service problem. These are a few possible reasons:\nHigh CPU load, there is not enough CPU power to handle the stream,\ncausing buffers to arrive late in the sink.\nNetwork problems\nOther resource problems such as disk load, memory bottlenecks etc\nThe measurements result in QOS events that aim to adjust the datarate in\none or more upstream elements. Two types of adjustments can be made:\nShort time \"emergency\" corrections based on latest observation in\nthe sinks.\nLong term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks.\nIt is also possible for the application to artificially introduce delay\nbetween synchronized buffers, this is called throttling. It can be used\nto limit or reduce the framerate, for example.\n\n\nHigh CPU load, there is not enough CPU power to handle the stream,\ncausing buffers to arrive late in the sink.\n\n\nNetwork problems\n\n\nOther resource problems such as disk load, memory bottlenecks etc\n\n\n\n\nShort time \"emergency\" corrections based on latest observation in\nthe sinks.\nLong term rate corrections based on trends observed in the sinks.\n\n\n"});
