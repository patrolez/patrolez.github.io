The QOS message contains the\ntimestamps of when something was dropped along with the amount of\ndropped vs processed items. Elements must post a QOS message under these\nconditions:\nThe element dropped a buffer because of QoS reasons.\nAn element changed its processing strategy because of QoS reasons\n(quality). This could include a decoder that decided to drop every B\nframe to increase its processing speed or an effect element\nthat switched to a lower quality algorithm.\n\n\nThe element dropped a buffer because of QoS reasons.\n\n\nAn element changed its processing strategy because of QoS reasons\n(quality).
