fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/events.html#flush-stop","fragment":"Flush Stop\nThe flush-stop event is sent by an element driving the pipeline after a\nflush-start and tells pads and elements downstream that they should\naccept events and buffers again (there will be at least a SEGMENT event\nbefore any buffers first though).\nIf your element keeps temporary caches of stream data, it should clear\nthem when it receives a FLUSH-STOP event (and also whenever its chain\nfunction receives a buffer with the DISCONT flag set).\nThe flush-stop event is created with gst_event_new_flush_stop (). It\nhas one parameter that controls if the running-time of the pipeline\nshould be reset to 0 or not. Normally after a flushing seek, the\nrunning_time is set back to 0.\n"});
