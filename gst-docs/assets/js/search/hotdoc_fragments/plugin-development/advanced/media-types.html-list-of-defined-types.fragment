They are split up\nin separate tables for audio, video, container, subtitle and other\ntypes, for the sake of readability. Below each table might follow a list\nof notes that apply to that table. In the definition of each type, we\ntry to follow the types and rules as defined by\nIANA for as far as\npossible.\nJump directly to a specific table:\nTable of Audio Types\nTable of Video Types\nTable of Container Types\nTable of Subtitle Types\nTable of Other Types\nNote that many of the properties are not required, but rather\noptional properties. This means that most of these properties can be\nextracted from the container header, but that - in case the container\nheader does not provide these - they can also be extracted by parsing\nthe stream header or the stream content. The policy is that your element\nshould provide the data that it knows about by only parsing its own\ncontent, not another element's content. Example: the AVI header provides\nsamplerate of the contained audio stream in the header. MPEG system\nstreams don't. This means that an AVI stream demuxer would provide\nsamplerate as a property for MPEG audio streams, whereas an MPEG demuxer\nwould not. A decoder needing this data would require a stream parser in\nbetween to extract this from the header or calculate it from the\nstream.\n\n\nTable of Audio Types\n\n\nTable of Video Types\n\n\nTable of Container Types\n\n\nTable of Subtitle Types\n\n\nTable of Other Types\n\n\n"});
