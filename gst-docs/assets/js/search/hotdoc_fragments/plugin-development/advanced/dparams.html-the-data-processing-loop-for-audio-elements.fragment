The problem here is that audio has a much higher\nrate. For PAL video one will e.g. process 25 full frames per second, but\nfor standard audio it will be 44100 samples. It is rarely useful to\nsynchronise controllable parameters that often. The easiest solution is\nalso to have just one synchronisation call per buffer processing. This\nmakes the control-rate depend on the buffer size.\nElements that need a specific control-rate need to break their data\nprocessing loop to synchronise every n-samples.\n"});
