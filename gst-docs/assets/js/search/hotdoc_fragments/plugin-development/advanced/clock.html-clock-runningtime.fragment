From the absolute-time is a running-time\ncalculated, which is simply the difference between a previous snapshot\nof the absolute-time called the base-time. So:\nrunning-time = absolute-time - base-time\nA GStreamer GstPipeline object maintains a GstClock object and a\nbase-time when it goes to the PLAYING state. The pipeline gives a handle\nto the selected GstClock to each element in the pipeline along with\nselected base-time. The pipeline will select a base-time in such a way\nthat the running-time reflects the total time spent in the PLAYING\nstate. As a result, when the pipeline is PAUSED, the running-time stands\nstill.\nBecause all objects in the pipeline have the same clock and base-time,\nthey can thus all calculate the running-time according to the pipeline\nclock.\n"});
