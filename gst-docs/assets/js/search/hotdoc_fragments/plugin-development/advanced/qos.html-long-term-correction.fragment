fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/qos.html#long-term-correction","fragment":"Long term correction\nLong term corrections are a bit more difficult to perform. They rely on\nthe value of the proportion in the QOS event. Elements should reduce the\namount of resources they consume by the proportion field in the QoS\nmessage.\nHere are some possible strategies to achieve this:\nPermanently dropping frames or reducing the CPU or bandwidth\nrequirements of the element. Some decoders might be able to skip\ndecoding of B frames.\nSwitch to lower quality processing or reduce the algorithmic\ncomplexity. Care should be taken that this doesn't introduce\ndisturbing visual or audible glitches.\nSwitch to a lower quality source to reduce network bandwidth.\nAssign more CPU cycles to critical parts of the pipeline. This\ncould, for example, be done by increasing the thread priority.\nIn all cases, elements should be prepared to go back to their normal\nprocessing rate when the proportion member in the QOS event approaches\nthe ideal proportion of 1.0 again.\n\n\nPermanently dropping frames or reducing the CPU or bandwidth\nrequirements of the element.
