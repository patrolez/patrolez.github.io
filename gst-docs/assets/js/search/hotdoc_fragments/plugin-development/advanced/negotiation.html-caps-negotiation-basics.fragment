It sends the selected media\nformat downstream on its source pad with a CAPS event. Downstream\nelements reconfigure themselves to handle the media type in the CAPS\nevent on the sinkpad.\nA downstream element can inform upstream that it would like to\nsuggest a new format by sending a RECONFIGURE event upstream. The\nRECONFIGURE event simply instructs an upstream element to restart\nthe negotiation phase. Because the element that sent out the\nRECONFIGURE event is now suggesting another format, the format in\nthe pipeline might change.\nIn addition to the CAPS and RECONFIGURE event and the CAPS query, there\nis an ACCEPT_CAPS query to quickly check if a certain caps can be\naccepted by an element.\nAll negotiation follows these simple rules. Let's take a look at some\ntypical uses cases and how negotiation happens.\n\n\nA downstream element suggest a format on its sinkpad and places the\nsuggestion in the result of the CAPS query performed on the sinkpad.\nSee also Implementing a CAPS query\nfunction.\n\n\nAn upstream element decides on a format.
