If the jitter is positive, the previous\nbuffer arrived late and we can be sure that a buffer with a timestamp <\ntimestamp + jitter is also going to be late. We can thus drop all\nbuffers with a timestamp less than timestamp + jitter.\nIf the buffer duration is known, a better estimation for the next likely\ntimestamp to arrive in time is: timestamp + 2 * jitter + duration.\nA possible algorithm typically looks like this:\n"});
