fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/events.html#flush-start","fragment":"Flush Start\nThe flush start event is sent downstream (in push mode) or upstream (in\npull mode) if all buffers and caches in the pipeline should be emptied.\n“Queue” elements will empty their internal list of buffers when they\nreceive this event, for example. File sink elements (e.g. “filesink”)\nwill flush the kernel-to-disk cache (fdatasync () or fflush ()) when\nthey receive this event. Normally, elements receiving this event will\nsimply just forward it, since most filter or filter-like elements don't\nhave an internal cache of data. gst_pad_event_default () does just\nthat, so for most elements, it is enough to forward the event using the\ndefault event handler.\nAs a side-effect of flushing all data from the pipeline, this event\nunblocks the streaming thread by making all pads reject data until they\nreceive a Flush Stop signal (elements trying to push data\nwill get a FLUSHING flow return and stop processing data).\nThe flush-start event is created with the gst_event_new_flush_start (). Like the EOS event, it has no properties. This event is usually\nonly created by elements driving the pipeline, like source elements\noperating in push-mode or pull-range based demuxers/decoders.\n"});
