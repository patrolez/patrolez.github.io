fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/request.html#request-pads","fragment":"Request pads\n“Request” pads are similar to sometimes pads, except that request are\ncreated on demand of something outside of the element rather than\nsomething inside the element. This concept is often used in muxers,\nwhere - for each elementary stream that is to be placed in the output\nsystem stream - one sink pad will be requested. It can also be used in\nelements with a variable number of input or outputs pads, such as the\ntee (multi-output) or input-selector (multi-input) elements.\nTo implement request pads, you need to provide a padtemplate with a\nGST_PAD_REQUEST presence and implement the request_new_pad virtual\nmethod in GstElement. To clean up, you will need to implement the\nrelease_pad virtual method.\n"});
