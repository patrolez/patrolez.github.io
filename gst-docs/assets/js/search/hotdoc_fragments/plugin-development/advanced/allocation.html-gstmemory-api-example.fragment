An\naccess mode (read/write) must be given when mapping memory. The map\nfunction returns a pointer to the valid memory region that can then be\naccessed according to the requested access mode.\nBelow is an example on creating a GstMemory object and using the\ngst_memory_map() to access the memory region.\n"});
