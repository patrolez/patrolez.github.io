High definition video uses many megabytes to store one\nsingle image frame. It is important to reuse memory when possible\ninstead of constantly allocating and freeing it.\nMultimedia systems usually use special-purpose chips, such as DSPs or\nGPUs to perform the heavy lifting (especially for video). These\nspecial-purpose chips usually have strict requirements for the memory\nthey operate on and how it is accessed.\nThis chapter talks about the memory-management features available to\nGStreamer plugins. We will first talk about the lowlevel GstMemory\nobject that manages access to a piece of memory and then continue with\none of it's main users, the GstBuffer, which is used to exchange data\nbetween elements and with the application. We will also discuss the GstMeta.\nThis object can be placed on buffers to provide extra info about them and\ntheir memory. We will also discuss the GstBufferPool, which allows to\nmore-efficiently manage buffers of the same size.\nTo conclude this chapter we will take a look at the GST_QUERY_ALLOCATION\nquery, which is used to negotiate memory management options between\nelements.\n"});
