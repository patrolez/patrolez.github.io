fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/events.html#seek-request","fragment":"Seek Request\nSeek events are meant to request a new stream position to elements. This\nnew position can be set in several formats (time, bytes or “default\nunits” [a term indicating frames for video, channel-independent samples\nfor audio, etc.]). Seeking can be done with respect to the end-of-file\nor start-of-file, and usually happens in upstream direction (downstream\nseeking is done by sending a SEGMENT event with the appropriate offsets\nfor elements that support that, like filesink).\nElements receiving seek events should, depending on the element type,\neither just forward it upstream (filters, decoders), change the format\nin which the event is given and then forward it (demuxers), or handle\nthe event by changing the file pointer in their internal stream resource\n(file sources, demuxers/decoders driving the pipeline in pull-mode) or\nsomething else.\nSeek events are built up using positions in specified formats (time,\nbytes, units). They are created using the function gst_event_new_seek (). Note that many plugins do not support seeking from the end of the\nstream. An element not driving the pipeline and forwarding a seek\nrequest should not assume that the seek succeeded or actually happened,\nit should operate based on the SEGMENT events it receives.\nElements parsing this event can do this using gst_event_parse_seek().\n"});
