GStreamer can operate in two scheduling mode,\ncalled push- and pull-mode. GStreamer supports elements with pads in any\nof the scheduling modes where not all pads need to be operating in the\nsame mode.\nSo far, we have only discussed _chain ()-operating elements, i.e.\nelements that have a chain-function set on their sink pad and push\nbuffers on their source pad(s). We call this the push-mode because a\npeer element will use gst_pad_push () on a srcpad, which will cause\nour _chain ()-function to be called, which in turn causes our element\nto push out a buffer on the source pad. The initiative to start the\ndataflow happens somewhere upstream when it pushes out a buffer and all\ndownstream elements get scheduled when their _chain ()-functions are\ncalled in turn.\nBefore we explain pull-mode scheduling, let's first understand how the\ndifferent scheduling modes are selected and activated on a pad.\n"});
