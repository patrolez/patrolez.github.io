The clock time doesn't always start from 0 or from some known\nvalue. Some clocks start counting from some known start date, other\nclocks start counting since last reboot, etc...\nAs clocks return an absolute measure of time, they are not usually used\ndirectly. Instead, differences between two clock times are used to\nmeasure elapsed time according to a clock.\n"});
