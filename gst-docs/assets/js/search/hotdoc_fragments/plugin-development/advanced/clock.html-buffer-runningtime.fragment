fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"plugin-development/advanced/clock.html#buffer-runningtime","fragment":"Buffer running-time\nTo calculate a buffer running-time, we need a buffer timestamp and the\nSEGMENT event that preceded the buffer. First we can convert the SEGMENT\nevent into a GstSegment object and then we can use the\ngst_segment_to_running_time () function to perform the calculation of\nthe buffer running-time.\nSynchronization is now a matter of making sure that a buffer with a\ncertain running-time is played when the clock reaches the same\nrunning-time. Usually this task is done by sink elements. Sink also have\nto take into account the latency configured in the pipeline and add this\nto the buffer running-time before synchronizing to the pipeline clock.\n"});
