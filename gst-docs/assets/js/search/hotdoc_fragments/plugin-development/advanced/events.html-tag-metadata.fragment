This is currently used to preserve tags during\nstream transcoding from one format to the other. Tags are discussed\nextensively in Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo). Most elements\nwill simply forward the event by calling gst_pad_event_default ().\nThe tag event is created using the function gst_event_new_tag (), but\nmore often elements will send a tag event downstream that will be\nconverted into a message on the bus by sink elements. All of these\nfunctions require a filled-in taglist as argument, which they will take\nownership of.\nElements parsing this event can use the function gst_event_parse_tag () to\nacquire the taglist that the event contains.\n"});
