Now, let's assume that all you want is to create a\nsimple audiosink that works exactly the same as, say, “esdsink”, or a\nfilter that simply normalizes audio volume. Such elements are very\ngeneral in concept and since they do nothing special, they should be\neasier to code than to provide your own scheduler activation functions\nand doing complex caps negotiation. For this purpose, GStreamer provides\nbase classes that simplify some types of elements. Those base classes\nwill be discussed in this chapter.\n"});
