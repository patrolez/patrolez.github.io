Currently, it does nothing\nyet but add another compile dependency, so derived classes will need to\nimplement all base-sink virtual functions. When they do this correctly,\nthis will have some positive effects on the end user experience with the\nvideosink:\nBecause of preroll (and the preroll () virtual function), it is\npossible to display a video frame already when going into the\nGST_STATE_PAUSED state.\nBy adding new features to GstVideoSink, it will be possible to add\nextensions to videosinks that affect all of them, but only need to\nbe coded once, which is a huge maintenance benefit.\n\n\nBecause of preroll (and the preroll () virtual function), it is\npossible to display a video frame already when going into the\nGST_STATE_PAUSED state.\n\n\nBy adding new features to GstVideoSink, it will be possible to add\nextensions to videosinks that affect all of them, but only need to\nbe coded once, which is a huge maintenance benefit.\n\n\n"});
