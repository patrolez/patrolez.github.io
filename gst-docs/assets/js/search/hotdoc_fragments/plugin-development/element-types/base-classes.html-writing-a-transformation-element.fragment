There is quite\na lot of bookkeeping that such elements need to do in order for things\nsuch as buffer allocation forwarding, passthrough, in-place processing\nand such to all work correctly. This base class does all that for you,\nso that you just need to do the actual processing.\nSince the GstBaseTransform is based on the 1-to-1 model for filters,\nit may not apply well to elements such as decoders, which may have to\nparse properties from the stream. Also, it will not work for elements\nrequiring more than one sourcepad or sinkpad.\n"});
