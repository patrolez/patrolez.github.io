GStreamer provides two base classes, similar\nto the two audiosinks described in Writing an audio\nsink; one is ringbuffer-based, and requires the\nderived class to take care of its own scheduling, synchronization and\nsuch. The other is based on this GstAudioBaseSrc and is called\nGstAudioSrc, and provides a simple open (), close () and read ()\ninterface, which is rather simple to implement and will suffice for most\nsoundserver sources and audio interfaces (e.g. ALSA or OSS) out there.\nThe GstAudioSrc base-class has several benefits for derived classes,\non top of the benefits of the GstPushSrc base-class that it is based\non:\nDoes syncronization and provides a clock.\nNew features can be added to it and will apply to all derived\nclasses automatically.\n\n\nDoes syncronization and provides a clock.\n\n\nNew features can be added to it and will apply to all derived\nclasses automatically.\n\n\n"});
