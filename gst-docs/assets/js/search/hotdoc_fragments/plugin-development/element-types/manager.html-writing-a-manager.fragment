Managers are generally a GstBin with\none or more ghostpads. Inside them is/are the actual element(s) that\nmatters. There is several cases where this is useful. For example:\nTo add support for private events with custom event handling to\nanother element.\nTo add support for custom pad _query () or _convert () handling\nto another element.\nTo add custom data handling before or after another element's data\nhandler function (generally its _chain () function).\nTo embed an element, or a series of elements, into something that\nlooks and works like a simple element to the outside world. This is\nparticular handy for implementing sources and sink elements with\nmultiple pads.\nMaking a manager is about as simple as it gets. You can derive from a\nGstBin, and in most cases, you can embed the required elements in the\n_init () already, including setup of ghostpads. If you need any custom\ndata handlers, you can connect signals or embed a second element which\nyou control.\n\n\nTo add support for private events with custom event handling to\nanother element.\n\n\nTo add support for custom pad _query () or _convert () handling\nto another element.\n\n\nTo add custom data handling before or after another element's data\nhandler function (generally its _chain () function).\n\n\nTo embed an element, or a series of elements, into something that\nlooks and works like a simple element to the outside world.
