Note that minimum required OS version for video decoder and\ndeinterlacing elements is Windows 8.\nPlugin feature names of decoders:\nSimilar to the video decoder case, deinterlacing element would be registered\nonly if its supported by hardware with the feature name d3d11deinterlace\nHowever, depending on the hardware it runs on, some elements might not be\nregistered in case that underlying hardware doesn't support the feature.\nFor a system with multiple Direct3D11 compatible hardwares (i.e., GPU),\nthere can be multiple plugin features having the same role.\nThe naming rule for the non-primary decoder element is\nd3d11{codec}device{index}dec where index is an arbitrary index number of\nhardware starting from 1.\nTo get a list of all available elements, user can run\n\nd3d11h264dec\nd3d11h265dec\nd3d11vp8dec\nd3d11vp9dec\nd3d11mpeg2dec\nd3d11av1dec\n\n"});
